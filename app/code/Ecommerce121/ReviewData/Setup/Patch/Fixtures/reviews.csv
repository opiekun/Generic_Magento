200011;nice bell;This gankogui is excellent for the two things I need most: an upper elementary drum class instrument & an instrument for church services that is not too overwhelming. I purchased 3 of them, and they sound excellent together. There were some jarring overtones in one of the upper bells, but since each is handmade, I guess it's 'luck of the draw'. If you are looking for an outdoor instrument, this isn't it. If you want a higher, ringing tone that settles into an ensemble, this is a good choice.;5;8/5/2010 10:00
200147;As promised!;Got my “A” and it’s working fine.  Purchase was smooth, delivery was as promised.  Happy all around.  Thank you West Music.;5;2/25/2013 10:00
200213;Just what I expected;The Studio 49 contrabass bars are a wonderful addition to any Orff Ensemble.  With the arrival of B, we now have the entire contrabass bar set.  The bar is exactly what was expected.  Love these instruments.;5;4/9/2013 10:00
200215;Warm Sound;I am so excited to use this C bar. It has such a wonderful tone. Much better quality than the other brand I used to have. This one is definitely worth the money!!;5;4/19/2018 10:00
200239;Basic Beat BBA25 25-note Resonator Bells set is EXCELLENT!;We are very pleased with the Basic Beat BBA25 25-note Resonator Bells set!  It has a very pleasing tone, and we love that the tone bars can be taken out and used individually.  There are as many mallets as there are tone bars, so we can engage many of our students at the same time to play a melody, or chords.  The case holds all of the bells in the set just like a piano or xylophone instrument, so it can also be used as a solo instrument.  It's great!;5;6/4/2013 10:00
200239;Resonator bells;Lovely tone. I used them yesterday in two 3rd grade classes (where I volunteer), and they learned how to make chords. They were very pleased with the sound/result.;5;10/15/2012 10:00
200240;Love these!;Great sound! I love that the colors coordinate with the desk bells because my color-coded scores can be used with these as well!;5;7/13/2011 10:00
200240;Best thing since sliced bread;Seriously -- I use these with kids from ages 3 through 14.  The sound quality is excellent -- nice ring and ping -- and the survive multiple droppings on hard floors and 3 year olds trying to pull them apart and 11 year olds seeing how hard they can hit the bells.  They store neatly in the box.  You can play 5ths in any key, and triads in 3 M and 3 m keys.  I've used them as rhythmic teaching tools as well as for accompaniment.  Buy an extra mallet per set if you need to play triads.  Fabulous product.;5;1/21/2019 20:22
200240;GREAT!;Great sound, great value! These movable bars are good for spatial awareness, organization and recognition of chords, range of motion ... and they come with a carrying case! Can't beat it!;5;6/25/2011 10:00
200242;Better that some...;Purchased this brand after purchasing a different one and the keys fell off before they even came out of the box.  Returned those and bought these as we already have this brand but just didn't want to pay twice what we paid for the others.  Decided that it would be worth the extra cost if the keys stayed on.  They did to a certain extent but one of the keys did pop off the first time we used it.  They are on better than the first product we purchased but they still come off so the  children definitely need to be reminded to only pick them up by the base.;4;10/27/2011 10:00
200249;Great product;These bells not only sound great, they are sturdy!  I used them in an school sing-along and this one set could be heard over 300 kids singing. Also, when I opened them up I accidently dropped them and they fell to my hard wooden floor...not one bell on the set fell off, got loose or even dented. I agree that they are heavy for young hands - I had two 2nd graders help eachother out and it was no problem.;5;9/17/2011 10:00
200249;glorious sound!;These sound lovely! Best sounding bells I own. A little heavy for small hands - they may need assistance!;5;6/26/2011 10:00
200259;Colorful and fun!;I ordered two of these bells for my 9-month old granddaughter who played with them in a baby music class. She loves them! The sounds are so satisfying. I also had a question and wanted to make an adjustment right after I placed my order. Jordan in customer service was terrific and made it happen.;5;6/19/2012 10:00
200261;super duper fun!;Sturdy, colorful, engaging, and fun! Provides opportunity to discuss animals and animal sounds. Love them!;5;6/27/2011 10:00
200264;So fun and easy to use;I purchase this for this 2017-2018 school year based on a music education blog I read. I love it so far. It is so easy to keep a steady beat while doing actions. It helps guides students who are just learning to keep the beat. I'm so pleased and the kids think it is too cool. We call it a Firiki in my class.;5;9/22/2012 10:00
200264;Great for Leading Ensembles;I use this instrument to keep the beat over my Orff Ensemble while directing them.   The sound cuts through all 20 instruments playing at the same time, and it allows me to have one hand free to give cues.  It is portable and lightweight to boot!;5;11/9/2018 8:28
200265;Excellent;Great for individuals with tactile sensory needs!;5;5/20/2012 10:00
200266;Bean bags;Good quality and sturdy!;5;4/27/2012 10:00
200267;bells come off easily;I liked these for the tactile stimulation aspect for special needs students, and the students loved playing them. The sound was good, too. The only problem is that after only a few weeks of use, the bells started coming off. They need to be re-engineered so the bells stay on. It's a great idea that needs improvement.;2;8/18/2011 10:00
200267;Great for individuals with sensory needs;I am a music therapist who works in special education a nd some of my students who need additional input LOVE these!;5;2/15/2019 14:15
200298;Matador bongos;Although these bongos have a good sound, and tune easily, they are a no-go for a busy classroom. Even though the bongos are not used everyday, one drum cracked within a year, and the bracing between the drums loosened within months.;2;8/15/2011 10:00
200333;Love This Drum!;This is a great addition to my drum collection. It is durable and a good size for little hands.;5;10/25/2012 10:00
200333;This little bongo of ours;"My husband and I bought a set of these bongos for our son when he was 3 years old.  He is now 18 years old.  We have now ordered a set for our granddaughter's third birthday from West music.  You see those bongos that we purchased for our son 15 years ago are still in perfect shape and sound just a good as the day we bought them.  Whenever our daughter, son in law and grandbaby comes to visit one of the first things Ava wants to do is play bongos with her pop pop whilst her uncle plays his guitar.  I highly recommend these bongos not just because they are made to outlast generations of toddlers but they are also beautiful with the vibrant rain forest pattern.  I also would like to thank Amy for her great costumer services and friendliness.

Sincerely

Sara J Smith";5;4/26/2011 10:00
200333;Best in Class;These are excellent instruments for small kids. They're durable, safe (no sharp edges, not too heavy), and sound surprisingly excellent! I wouldn't use any other bongos for small children.;5;6/7/2013 10:00
200342;Boomwhackers;great to teach how the physics of music work;5;9/13/2011 10:00
200344;For all ages;students love to sound them;5;2/4/2012 10:00
200346;Kids love them!;My kids can earn BOOM Days!  If they can spell BOOM by earning a letter a day on their behavior.  They really look forward to BOOM day and they are also learning how to read music and playing an instrument, and they are cheap enough everyone has a tube;5;5/25/2011 10:00
200346;Boomwhackers;My students really enjoyed these! I have found it easier for the students to use with the octavator caps I purchased with the boomwhackers.;5;12/2/2011 10:00
200346;great fun;We have not used these much yet, other than for exploration, but I can see we will be able to get a great deal of use out of them.  The size of this set is great for our 0-5 age group.;5;1/18/2012 10:00
200346;Great product;The students in our Music room love using the boom wackers.;5;8/28/2011 10:00
200346;Fun and Easy to play;"The children have fun and learn how to read music and compose songs in groups! these colored musical tubes are the best teaching tools any music teacher could have !

I highly recommend them.";5;6/11/2011 10:00
200346;Students love;i use in the classroom;5;2/5/2012 10:00
200346;We love Boomwhackers!;Boomwhackers are so cheap, and such an easy instrument to get out for students and use.  The colors make it easy for students to learn notation and new songs.;5;5/14/2011 10:00
200346;Boomwhacker order;I love ordering from West Music! I was able to take advantage of a great sale. The boomwhackers were in stock and they arrived at my school about 5 days after I ordered. Great service! Wonderful products!;5;5/31/2012 10:00
200346;Fantastic product!;A great tool for visualizing the relationship between parallel major and minor scales.;5;4/18/2012 10:00
200346;Love;love the Boomwhackers!;5;9/5/2011 10:00
200346;Awesome products!;Our students love these things! They get to hit their knee, the floor, a chair, and even other Boomwhackers!;5;10/20/2012 10:00
200348;great addition to set;The students enjoy playing melodies with these boomwhackers;5;8/29/2011 10:00
200348;Classroom instruments;These Boomwhackers perfectly completed our classroom set. Students beg me to play the instruments and adding in the chromatic set gave me an opportunity to expand my lesson with my students! I am very glad I decided to purchase these as an addition to my classroom set.;5;3/17/2012 10:00
200357;Nice Sound;nice sound, good choice for beginners.;5;4/17/2012 10:00
200358;Im so glad;"This drum is far greater than I couldve imagined. The tone is perfect; well rounded with a good amount of bass to resonate to ones core. Its tradition is what inspired me, as a Reiki Practitioner and its easy to carry capabilities make it a great choice for party time as well.. Thanks Remo and West Music!";5;6/16/2013 10:00
200358;Buffalo drum 16” White;I love the look and the sound of this drum. The price is the best. Thank you;5;3/17/2013 10:00
200359;I'm happy;great price, fast shipping, and a reliable chat that sealed the deal.;5;9/23/2012 10:00
200390;Perfect for Little Hands;I love this cabasa for my 5-8 year old students.  It sounds brighter and thinner than a full-sized cabasa, but it is very much easier for little hands to manipulate.;5;7/18/2011 10:00
200392;Good, but may come apart!;While I've had no problems with my smaller cabasas, this particular one has unscrewed on several occasions.  It's easy enough to put back together, though!  Great for sensory integration, but very heavy.;3;8/25/2011 10:00
200414;Beautiful tones;I am very happy with the chimes, pleasing sounds, good for music therapy groups, easy to hold.;5;3/11/2013 10:00
200454;Music to my ears!;Great little chime.  I use it for meditation and yoga classes.  Students really enjoy it and the price is right. Cheers!;5;2/26/2013 10:00
200454;Great Service;All went well with my purchase!;5;11/16/2012 10:00
200454;Excellent product;I bought this for my classroom as a way to grab students' attention.  The quality of the chime is amazing and sounds beautiful.;5;8/18/2012 10:00
200458;great sound!;Well worth the price.  These claves have a great sound and are very durable.  Isn't that what every music teacher wants?;5;6/28/2011 10:00
200460;Always a favorite!;"My students (0-5) love experimenting with this and they are so excited when they ""get it""!";5;4/16/2013 10:00
200460;kid-friendly kokiriko!;Love this kid-friendly kokiriko!  Very sturdy.;5;6/29/2011 10:00
200484;Awesome;"I got this cowbell for my birthday and I love it!  It's just like the one from the SNL skit ""More Cowbell"".  It sounds and feels great!";5;6/13/2011 10:00
200597;SO FUN!;I purchased this book to replace the no-longer-working cricket sound in my Very Quiet Cricket Book by Eric Carle.  The kids loved the sound it makes!  They all wanted to take turns playing it, and it doubled as a short insect anatomy lesson! :);5;5/21/2011 10:00
200597;Love the cricket!;Interesting looking & authentic sounding.  The little antennae that came with the cricket did not stay in, but they are not necessary for how the cricket works, so it doesn't matter.;5;9/28/2011 10:00
200597;Good Sound Effect;This is a great sound effect instrument!;5;10/29/2012 10:00
200597;West Music WM06 Cricket Rasp;While it makes a good cricket sound, it is a little quieter than I hoped.  It will work, but may get lost in some soundscapes if other things are being played. My students do like the design, though.;5;3/25/2012 10:00
200606;Black straps fall off;Bought quite a few of these for my classrooms.  They worked fine, until the black straps came off.  They did this at the start.  Trying to repair them with the flimsy plastic piece does not work.  Buy a higher quality set that you can actually use.;2;9/15/2011 10:00
200606;Fine Finger Cymbals;These are the right price. The straps do slip off, but they are easily sewn together with a few threads/knots on each side of the elastic end past the white plastic buckle. It just requires that someone do that before use with students, and it’s a fix that will last. My students love the *ching!* magical sound.;4;8/19/2021 4:33
200607;high quality!;These have a nice sound and are also higher quality than I expected!  Children love these and they provide nice opportunities to discuss dynamics.;5;7/12/2011 10:00
200607;Pure, beautiful sound!;Love these finger cymbals.  I will need to hot glue the backs because straps easily come through the hole.  Otherwise, they work great!;5;12/30/2011 10:00
200607;Great classroom instrument;These finger cymbals have a very good sound and are easy for students to handle.;5;1/6/2013 10:00
200671;Great drum!;This drum is a great size -- not too big, and not to small -- for a wide variety of applications, from performances to music classes to drum circles. The tonal range is great, providing bright, poppy high tones and very nice, rich low tones (when properly tuned). Details like covered lug nuts (no snags) and carrying handle make it even nicer. Also, the weight and size make it easy to play standing, using a strap, for a longer time without fatigue. I love this drum.;5;3/12/2012 10:00
200678;Remo Kids Pre-Tuned Djembe;My two year old granddaughter received this lovely djembe and to join me in regular djembe jams.  She loved it and wore it around the house, drumming for parades with anyone who would join in.  Later at about 4 years, she somehow managed to get her foot into it from the bottom, like a boot, caught in a photo that her dad posted on Facebook.  Luckily, no limbs or drums were damaged in the making of that photo! Sturdy, fun, definitely kid-friendly and a worthy start to a life with rhythm and music!;5;6/22/2011 10:00
200736;great for the price;"At this price, this drum is a great value!  It is a great alternative for those who don't want to pay for the larger ""fish"" ocean drums.  The plastic dents easily, but the children playing it surely won't care.  It has a great sound and provides loads of entertainment.  Great sensory input for those with intellectual and developmental disabilities.";4;6/30/2011 10:00
200746;Great size for younger children!;I have been using this drum in my music therapy practice with children for a few years, and it is a great size!  I like that the feet elevate the drum enough to provide a good sound, and the height is great for setting in front of a younger child.  The colorful children from around the world on the outside of the drum can be slightly distracting for the occasional child, but they can also be great conversation and song starters!;5;6/7/2011 10:00
200746;Great drum;Colorful, durable, and sounds great for a classroom instrument.;5;8/15/2011 10:00
200746;love this drum!;my baby/toddler music class teacher, miss carla, swears by remo drums.  we frequently use the small floor tom in class, and my 2-year old daughter loves it.  my husband and i bought this for her 2nd birthday, and she couldn't be happier!  (her daddy and her pop-pop get a lot of fun out of it too!)  this is an excellent way to introduce rhythm to a small child.;5;8/8/2011 10:00
200747;Spreading Joy;I bought this drum for my grandchildren to expose them to different kinds of musical instruments. It’s a Xmas gift but I know they will love it so I’m buying a second one today. Great quality and the sound is nice to the ear 💕;3;11/7/2020 15:22
200747;Great gift idea;I am a Music Therapist and a mother of two boys.  For years, I have been buying Remo drums as baby gifts for friends and family--as well as for my own home and private practice.  As soon as 'baby' is old enough to sit up, I have someone sit behind the baby and straddle the drum while playing with open hands and singing!  This drum has smooth edges, it's durable, colorful, and you can flip it over and use for storage for shakers, whistle, kazoos, maracas...Music Music Music!!!  My children and my students LOVE this drum! It has a rich sound and its a REAL drum--no batteries needed folks! Stock up--this is a great price!;5;11/8/2010 10:00
200747;Wonderful and sturdy!;One of two Remo drums that I got my granddaughter, at the time 3 years old.  She loved using it when friends came over and the matching djembe created an instant set for a rhythm duo.  The sticks are fun but when unmanageable by young ones, hands or multiple sets of hands make yet another option for this size drum.  We hoped to hand this drum to the next grandchild, but it may be hard for granddaughter to let go for some years..  So, another purchase is in order, and not expensive.  Worth every dollar!;5;6/23/2011 10:00
200747;Wonderful Drum;My grandson who just turned 2 years old, goes to a children's group music class.  Westmusic.com was the recommendation by the teacher as to the place to go for instruments. My daughter-in-law suggested this drum for a birthday gift.  My grandson just loves it.  It is so well built and so beautiful to look at.;5;5/15/2012 10:00
200747;Awesome, versatile.;"I am a board-certified music therapist in private practice, primarily working with children with intellectual disabilities and this drum can be used so many different ways!



The drum has an excellent, warm sound when struck with the hands or with the mallet. The mallets that come with the drum are more appropriate for kids 5+, so my little ones just use their hands...both scenarios of use still warrant great sound.



The animal print on the drum is great for animal and color identification. One of my clients particularly enjoys all of the frogs!



Definitely recommend this drum to music therapists, families, music educators, and those looking for a great gift for a child who responds to music!";5;5/3/2011 10:00
200747;Lasts!;I have been teaching preschool music for 15 years .  Some of my drums I bought 15 years ago and some just a few years ago.  I teach 5-7 classes per day and use the drums in almost every class.  Many parents like to buy these drums for their children as Christmas gifts.  My selling point is, I ask parents to pick out the drums that 15 years old from the ones that are 2 years old - they cannot!  These drums are great and last forever!;5;5/29/2011 10:00
200762;Very pleased;Purchased two gathering drums for use in toddler and early music classes at our private music studio.  Kids absolutely love them!  Pleased with quality and sound.  Very pleased with quick service through West Music - rapid shipping and excellent communication.;5;7/8/2012 10:00
200762;A fun instrument!;All of my students (age 3 - 6th Grade) LOVE to play this drum and often beg to play it during class.  It has such a nice, big sound and I love that it can sit on the floor.;5;5/8/2013 10:00
200762;Gathering Drum Fun;I purchased this with gift money for my music classroom.  I put 6 Kinders around it, and they each took turns playing something for each other, then question and answer with a partner while I helped other children in the class.  It has a lovely resonate tone.;5;7/29/2012 10:00
200762;Awesome sound, perfect size;This drum has an amazing sound and the babies in my music classes love gathering around it, placing their tiny hands on the huge surface, feeling the smoothness and experiencing how their hands can produce such large 'booms'. A great way to foster community amongst the littlest 'drummers'. Always a favorite in my studio!;5;8/24/2012 10:00
200762;Terrific Drum;Great with toddlers and babies, as well as preschoolers. Grownups like it too! The one-piece foot-cladding (what's it really called?) is a good improvement - my original one from 20 yrs ago is still an awesome drum, but missing a couple of feet.;5;5/12/2012 10:00
200762;New Drum Feet are Slippery;I've used various iterations of this gathering drum for a few years.  They keep changing the style of the feet. The old ones were pretty blocky and help secure the drums together if you had to stack them one on top of the other. The feet would knd of interlock with each other.  The new ones are rounded and slippery, so they slide a bit.  I haven't played on these yet, but I liked the new sound dampening inserts on the inside of the drum in the most recent version before these.  So, I'm hoping they will sound the same.  Just wish the feet were less slippery, since I always have to stack them.;5;5/7/2012 10:00
200762;Excellent, high quality, and perfect for group drumming!;Engaging graphics and the Remo name originally drew me to these drums for my early childhood music education classes. The quality and sound did not disappoint either.The children loved exploring these drums and were surprised by the graphics on the drum head when they turned it upside down!;5;6/16/2012 10:00
200762;Awesome, Quality Drums;I’m using 3 of these gathering drums in my Music Together in the Hills class which is for children ages 0-5. The drums are so durable and have fun art that make them really enjoyable to beat on !;5;6/10/2013 10:00
200762;Good timbre;Deep, full sound with ongoing vibration. It’s just a bit too small for more than 2 children to play on.  I’d wanted to fit 3 around the drum but it’s too small. My 11 year old client loves it but just for herself as she is getting too big to share a drum this small. Otherwise excellent sound.;5;3/2/2013 10:00
200763;Great gathering drum;"I ordered this BIG gathering drum for the elementary school, K-5th graders where I taught general music.  The kindergarten classes LOVED it!  Not only could they feel the beat, we watched each other as we played, ""Can you catch the beat"", sort of like a wave at the ballpark.  We also used it to see how many of each grade could sit around it, and then graphed it (reinforcing math skills):  21 kindergarteners was the winning classroom.  Super for assemblies, too, or adding extra students to an already full drumline!";5;5/2/2011 10:00
200769;Exactly what I have been looking for quite a while.;Have been looking for something this good, at this price, for quite a while.  The tone is fine, shipment was quick, and it turns out (surprisingly) that I even like the bright colored bars . . . so I keep the lid open as it lives on the table in my recording studio (seem to bring some fun into the room).;5;4/22/2013 10:00
200769;Best for this type of Instrument;"After trying several brands and types of glockenspiels/ bells, this is the one I have chosen for my general music classes.  These are the reasons why this one stood out to me: 1)It has enough notes for students to learn to play every note on the treble clef; 2)the bars are wide enough (the Sonor BWG are too small); 3) the rainbow colored notes are a logical pattern and students find it easier to learn with colored bars vs. the plain wood bars on our Orff xylophones; 4) the lid of case is perfect for propping up our music note books; and 5) the individual bars are removable and there are F# and Bb replacement bars for playing in other keys.  I use these instruments with the ""Mr. Everybody's Musical Apartment"" Curriculum to teach students to read with the letter names the notes on the treble clef.  Bells require a lot less hand coordination compared to recorders and ukuleles.  So when you have a short amount of time, you can get much more accomplished in the music reading unit because the instruments are easier to play. I put as the title ""Best for this type of Instrument"" because they are slightly out of tune and a little too loud.  Since I have a classroom playing them, I would like them to be softer. If you want a truly in tune instrument you will have to spend twice as much and they won't come in rainbow colors.";5;10/1/2011 10:00
200782;Small, portable, great sound!;These instruments are FANTASTIC! I teach in a small space on an even smaller budget and needed to supplement my Orff instruments with something high quality at an affordable price...these glocks are PERFECT!!! They have a great sound and even my middle school students don't mind playing them. :) <br />Outstanding product. Highly recommended!;5;11/3/2012 10:00
200789;Rich, beautiful sound;I am 57 years old and wanted to learn how to play the glockenspiel.  I decided on this instrument after hearing how it sounded on YouTube.  Shipping was prompt and the instrument was well-packed with no damage.  Honestly, this instrument sounds even better live and it is really easy to use with the mallets provided.  The instrument is very sturdy, well-made.  The bars are marked with the alphabet letters and are easy to read.  The bars are well-fixed to the unit and are easy to switch out as needed.  I really enjoy playing this instrument and I think you will too!  I would not hesitate to recommend this instrument to anyone at any age.;5;5/15/2013 10:00
200890;Love It!;This Gourd Guiro is a beautiful addition to my small percussion classroom collection!;5;3/3/2012 10:00
200895;Kids love these!;I am a k-6 music teacher in a public school. Of all my unhitched percussion, this is my favorite. A unique sound, quality/durable construction by LP, and a classroom favorite.;5;10/25/2011 10:00
200918;Remo Drums;This drums are exactly what I hoped they would be for the music classroom.  The students have enjoyed them.  I like the weight of them and also I like the width.  They are easy for the students to hold in there hand.;5;4/23/2018 10:00
200921;3rd Grade;"These are the perfect size for my third graders to use in class. The students are able to hold both the drum and the mallet at the same time comfortably. The sound is nice with the mallet, but very ""dead"" sounding without it.";5;2/2/2013 10:00
200921;Great starter set!;My new classroom only had three small drums, and I like to do a lot more with drums than those three allowed. I was looking for good quality (Remo is awesome) and also a set that could be very portable for programs and center work. These fit the bill--they are very affordable, but great quality! Thanks Remo and West Music!;5;12/1/2012 10:00
200923;So much fun for us and baby!;We purchased this drum for our newborn daughter. When she was around 4 months old, she was able to use the mallet to hit the drum which was super exciting for us and so much fun for her. It is a very nice and high quality drum that is also pretty inexpensive. Highly recommend!!;5;8/31/2012 10:00
200924;Super deal!;Nicely made.  Very attractive set.  They neatly nest for storage. Remo has a reputation for durability -- I'm confident these meet those standards.;5;1/24/2012 10:00
200924;Excellent quality!;These drums have a beautiful tone quality and are just what I was hoping for!;5;1/10/2013 10:00
200926;AMAZING DRUMS!!!!;These are the best drums I have ever used for elementary music! The students would rather play these than any other I have!;5;1/15/2013 10:00
200929;Love it;Love the price. Love the sound!;5;1/1/2012 10:00
200951;Awesome!;I love these because they are light, easy to hold, and dont take up much storage room.  Working with older adults is also nice as they make a liltte more sound then a shaker (they can hear themselves better) but it is not overpowering!;5;5/11/2011 10:00
200985;Lollidrum...;This drum is added to the four I currently have and use frequently!!!  Great for classroom use!;5;11/16/2011 10:00
201012;Love it!;We purchased many baby instruments for our daughter and this instrument is her absolute favorite. Its very light and easy for her to shake around and she loves looking at the colorful beds inside. This toy is also dishwasher safe so cleaning it is very easy.;5;8/30/2012 10:00
201013;Great durability and sound.;These were bought as an addition to my classroom's music focus on mariachi. They're terrific!;4;11/8/2011 10:00
201014;Music Therapist;These maracas are okay but I would not purchase them again or recommend them. The paint comes off when I have to sanitize them which is frequently due to facility protocol. Additionally, the sound seems to be almost muted or muffled, not the crisp sound I had hoped for. However, they seem to be quite durable as mine have been hit against tables and thrown  If you do not have to sanitize/clean and are looking for durable wooden maracas these may be okay for your use.;3;8/19/2011 10:00
201053;Love it;I am the music teacher at my school I ordered this Ocean Drum, it is great.  Not only was the company super fast with getting it here but the drum is well made and holding up to even my Kindergartners really well.;5;4/20/2012 10:00
201053;Looks great, pleased with weight of beads and sound!;I am a music therapist and I like to use this drum for sensory purposes, mainly. It has been a success so far!;5;10/9/2012 10:00
201076;Fun Times;This set is a great collection. I started my therapy practice with this set. It has a little bit of everything to get started. The fish guiro is always a delight to the kids. So are the shakers.;4;5/23/2011 10:00
201086;Remo WMD Package A is GREAT!!;After taking Will Scmid's World Music Drumming course I had to get the Remo World Music Drumming (Package A) it'is a great set of drums perfect for my middle school general music classes!  With 16 drums and a leader's drum, there are enough drums for everyone to play at the same time without waiting to share an instrument.  The additional percussion instruments are also great to add different timbres to the sound of the drums.  I have also used these in my church and am looking to purchase another set to use there.  These are lots of fun to play and immediately gets everyone involved in music making!;5;5/20/2011 10:00
201089;Spectacular Instruments;"We love our World Music Drumming set.  They arrived in a timely manner and the students love playing in ""a band"".";5;5/23/2013 10:00
201097;Music Teacher;This set was a wonderful addition to my classroom! The price was great, especially for the quality of sound and variety of drums that are included in the set. Also, each drum has rubber non-slip feet that allow students to keep the drum on the floor while playing. I am looking forward to purchasing another set in the future!;5;6/3/2011 10:00
201097;Perfectly sized for smaller hands, great sound, lots of fun;Ordered this set of drums to use with my children in homeschooling, as well as for leisurely play. They are a big hit with the whole family. Each drum has a great sound, and is perfectly sized not to be too overwhelming for smaller hands. Love that I could get quality drums sized for my kids, but still playable and enjoyable for adults. Highly recommended.;5;5/30/2011 10:00
201097;Great Deal;I ordered this set to use with my primary grade music classes.  They are just the right size for my students and have an enjoyable tone.  The price for this set was a great value - especially with free shipping - so I was able to order more instruments for my classroom.;5;6/1/2011 10:00
201111;Great NOISE;This is quite possibly the most pure sounding ratchet on the market.  It is also very capable of any of your ratchet needs.  I bought this for a ratchet festival (held in my backyard) and everyone was simply amazed with the quality.  Do yourself a favor and pick one of these bad boys up and you won't be disappointed.;5;3/4/2019 9:08
201111;Ratchet;This ratchet is very loud, maybe too loud.  Used with a bunch of schoolkids they broke the wood out fairly quickly so that it no longer worked. However, used by an adult, I imagine it would last awhile and does make an interesting sound.;4;9/21/2010 10:00
201111;Great ratchet;Love it. Nice and loud and crisp. I ordered small percussion for choral song that calls for loud noise makers in several places.;4;12/5/2011 10:00
201111;LOUD;Like the previous reviewer, my ratchet also broke.  It was much louder than I expected it would be.  Too loud to use just for fun with my classes of children.  If someone had a deliberate use for it and treated it well it may fare better than mine did!;4;7/1/2011 10:00
201111;Love It!;This Ratchet is a sturdy addition to my small percussion classroom collection.;4;3/6/2012 10:00
201115;colorful and engaging!;The bright colors are just as engaging as the beautiful sound! This rainstick projects well and is very sturdy.  A great buy!  My students love it!;5;7/2/2011 10:00
201128;Well made;Love the sound of this size, and the product is well made out of sturdy wood.;5;5/19/2013 10:00
201129;Frog;Works and sounds great!;5;4/28/2012 10:00
201132;Hand-crafted Tiny Frog Rasp is Beautiful and Fun!;"I am very pleased with the quality and usability of the Itty Bitty Frog Rasp! So far, in my music therapy sessions and in casual jams and instrument explorations, children and adults alike have gravitated towards this adorable instrument. I recommend using it with the book ""The First Music"" by Dylan Pritchett, which tells the musical story of the frogs finding their voice. I was preparing an intervention for children using this book by practicing with adult friends and they loved it and encouraged me to try it with adult groups as well. Even though this frog rasp is ""itty bitty"", it has a mighty and pleasing sound! Great for educators, music therapists, and all of us with musical instrument collections!";5;7/25/2012 10:00
201137;Goat Hoof Rattles;Great sounding ankle bells! Rich timbre and reliable attachment.;5;8/23/2011 10:00
201142;Well-made beautiful rattle;Great-sound wood rattle. I ordered small percussion for choral song that calls for loud noise makers in several places.;5;12/6/2011 10:00
201175;great sound, needs a case;"I have always been impressed with the Sonor ""sound"", so full and just sweet. I am trying to find a good way to re-use the shipping box as a case for this bell set. Sad that it doesn't come with one. Probably will try using duct tape to strengthen it, and maybe some felt for the inside. A little funky, but I have seen these bells get roughed up when they're stored in an open plastic bin.";4;4/27/2013 10:00
201210;Another fun set!;I liked the array of instruments in this set also. The kids seem to enjoy this set. My only complaint is that the sandpaper on the sand blocks fell off quickly and refused to stay on. But still a good set.;4;5/24/2011 10:00
201211;Great for Homeschool groups;We ordered this package for our homeschool co-op and it has worked out wonderfully!  The products are well-made and look like they will hold up well!;5;10/6/2012 10:00
201253;Perfect for toddlers and pre-k;Our library bought this set for a musical storytime program. They've met our expectations by being durable, kid-friendly, loud enough, and the ability to clean/disinfect. They are small and are perfect for small hands (toddlers and pre-k). I probably wouldn't recommend for elementary aged children.;5;8/16/2012 10:00
201357;It's perfect;This is perfect for my older elementary students.  They are developing better team building as we work on dynamics, coordination, and different rhythms.;5;12/26/2011 10:00
201357;General;Actually, I don´t know how and when to use it. I bought it because is cheap and curious.;5;6/26/2012 10:00
201357;Super!;"Between two teaching positions, I have access to 55 pairs of these sticks.  Only one has chipped, and it's just a small piece that's fallen off.  My only complaint would be that the black ""Basic Beat"" logo is getting smeary after the sticks have been used quite a bit. That said, it's purely a cosmetic issue.";5;5/17/2011 10:00
201358;Very good;"I bought 30 pairs for my toddler music class.  I love that they are natural wood instead of painted; I felt like paint would easily chip and get into my students' mouths.  All except for 3 of the sticks were perfect!  I will be sanding down some splinters from the 3 slightly imperfect sticks.";5;7/15/2012 10:00
201358;Perfect for little hands - and big ones!;I've used these in my Music Together classes for 8 years now. I love the size, the stoutness, the lack of paint. None have broken, only a couple have had any splintering (easily sanded out) - and they get chewed and used hard and frequently.;5;5/13/2012 10:00
201358;Really great rhythm sticks;"These rhythm sticks are great, especially for preschoolers. They seem to whack each other more with the longer ones, but these 8"" ones are perfect. Also, they are durable and the finish is lovely. I get tired of techni-colored stuff for children. Highly recommended.";5;11/23/2011 10:00
201358;Perfect for beginners;My younger elementary students love this.  Perfect for beginners as they figure out coordination and team building.;5;12/25/2011 10:00
201358;great quality and size;Bought several to use with our 0-5 age playgroup.  They are very sturdy.  The finish is of great quality.  They will last indefinitely.;5;1/21/2012 10:00
201426;Tambourines to GLORY!!!!!;I just want to say that these tambourines are GREAT!  I have been using them with my kinder class.  They have a good sound, and are sturdy instruments.  I have purchased 30 of them and can you imagine 30 of these darlings in the hands of 30 Kindergartener's?  It is.... TAMBOURINES to GLORY.  Great for rhythm work, exploring sound and rhythmic patterns, echo patterns.  I bought some cheaper ones that are transparent, and unfortunately the heads pop off and the tambourine can fall apart if hit too hard.  I wish I had found these first, but oh well.....I am glad that I purchased these!;5;7/28/2012 10:00
201431;Awsome purchasing experience!!!!;This is the first time purchasing from West Music and I will definitely return to buy again!! The process was real easy and with automatic shipping calculations. The items I ordered were exactly what I was looking for and the shipping was extremely fast!! Very satisfied customer!!!;5;11/17/2011 10:00
201435;Great Product!;I had originally purchased WestCo brand tambourines for my elementary music room, but returned them because the quality was lacking. These are what I bought instead and I love them! They have a nice sound and are of great quality. I highly recommend them!;5;12/19/2012 10:00
201436;"8"" tambourines.";I purchased these tambourines for two of my students who are learning an Italian Tarantella dance. They are great quality and look very professional. Extremely happy with them.;5;5/14/2012 10:00
201492;Great sound;Love this product, it is a great sound and a great price.;5;5/18/2013 10:00
201492;Tie dyed classic!;I had avoided this purchase because I had only see much larger and expensive ones.  This is a must have in any elementary music classroom!  The cost is a very worthwhile investment!;5;11/15/2011 10:00
201493;Great addition to our supply!;I am new at this school and I wanted to add to the already extensive instrument collection. We had a Halloween Concert and I ordered the Thunder Tube to use as a sound effect during one of the poetry readings and the kids loved it!;5;1/20/2013 10:00
201494;"Remo SP-0207-TS 7 x 2 1/4"" Thunder Tube, Starry Night";Great for making soundscapes.  Our art teacher especially liked the Starry Night decoration.;5;3/24/2012 10:00
201515;Triangle;The triangles have a quality sound and I like how the triangles have a nice mallet with a handle easy for play!;5;3/26/2013 10:00
201578;perfect for the young hand drummer!;I have used Remo Kids Tubanos in my Marimba Magic (R) classes for 5-10 year olds for many years. They have a good bass tone, as well as a crisper tone on the edge. With these 2 tones we can make many different patterns and challenge right and left hand coordination. I have Remo Kids Tubanos in perfect condition which have been used continuously for 20 years. These drums not only sound good, but are durable and will maintain their good sound.;5;10/22/2012 10:00
201578;this is cool.;"I know that all you snobs want the tunable drums, but this is a great way to inexpensively get your kids playing.

Mine is about twelve years old, and still working fine.

I reccomend highly.";5;3/18/2011 10:00
201578;Great Drum Value!;Agree with previous review: this is a great-sounding drum, with real highs and lows, built like a tank (mine has lasted over a decade), easily portable. What's not to like?;5;6/14/2011 10:00
201582;Great service and products;I have ordered 6 of the tuned Remo drums for our music room. It's great they are portable and the sound is good. Kids enjoy all 3 sizes and like hearing the different sounds. The shipping is very quick and the drums arrive in great boxes for storing in over the summer.;5;11/1/2012 10:00
201586;Remo 100 Series Tubano;Wonderful tone!  I will be purchasing more of this series in various sizes!;5;6/8/2012 10:00
201588;OH MAN!;The quality and sale price was AWESOME!  The shipping was fast and safe!  The sound of the drum is the best quality of anything in my classroom.  I will be looking to add more of these in the future!;5;11/14/2011 10:00
201588;Beautiful drum;It is a beautiful drum.  Sound is true. We love it;5;4/24/2012 10:00
201588;classroom favorite;classroom favorite;5;7/7/2021 13:01
201589;Happy!;I have been wanting to get this Remo tubano for several years! I love the sound with 3 distinct tones. It is sturdy but also easy to carry.  I highly recommend these tunable tubano by Remo.;5;1/13/2013 10:00
201592;Gorgeous drum;This drum is really beautiful and great sound.;5;5/17/2013 10:00
201592;Peanut Butter Jam instrument set;Great quality instruments for longevity and the kids love to play them!;5;1/17/2013 10:00
201592;Beautiful tone;As a percussionist and teacher I want the drums for my classroom to sing like a voice... these do just that. My students can easily move them because of the handle, and they tune easily with the included wrench. The molded feet allow the bottom of the drum to lift up off the ground, but also allow the instrument to be stable. Thank you REMO.;5;3/16/2013 10:00
201593;Great purchase!;These drums are exactly as I'd hoped!  They have a great, vibrant but warm sound with great resonance.  They are extremely versatile and look awesome, too!;5;4/26/2013 10:00
201594;Tubana drum;The Tubana's are great drums in my elementary music class;5;4/26/2012 10:00
201611;great product and service;I was able to order from the exhibitor at my state conference.  The quality is great and the service was fast and very friendly.;5;6/10/2011 10:00
201613;Latin Percussion LP208 Standard Vibraslap;It works great, just as expected.  My students enjoy using it.;5;3/19/2012 10:00
201613;Rich sound!;Very fun to play!  Also has a rich, exotic sound.  Children are captivated by this!;5;6/24/2011 10:00
201731;Palisono instruments;I have been a classroom music teacher for 7 years and I chose Palisono over rosewood bars because of their indestructibility in the hands of elementary students.  The customer service at West Music is incredible.  With a smile, they always rose to my challenging requests.  I would suggest that the hard, blue yarn mallets be the replacements for the white felt mallets.  White felt ones have a 2-3 year life span in the hands of grades 1-8. May West Music be a service to the music community for many years to come.;5;8/6/2011 10:00
201731;Excellent Choice for Music Therapists;This xylophone has a lovely sound quality and is very resilient in humid climates. I have a private practice for music therapy where I travel frequently around a very humid climate (Tampa Bay, FL). I've had this instrument for three years now and it is still in mint condition! I highly recommend it for other MTs-BC or teachers who travel between classrooms/schools.;5;4/19/2012 10:00
201738;Love the 2 octaves;I love the 2 octaves on the instrument, it allows me to put two students on one instrument which saves time getting out more instruments and money from having to buy another mallet instrument.  I can also rest easier with the fiberglass bars, knowing that my classroom is not an ideal climate for wood bars.;5;5/28/2011 10:00
201750;Tone;"The tone is great: quite rich and dark; the bars are easily removed; the construction is excellent.  I wish for the cost that it had side storage for the extra bars.";4;3/8/2012 10:00
201766;Excellent;Stir xylophones are such fun instruments and always a favorite among my students. This is a high quality instrument and is a good size for elementary school and up. It's a little large for young preschoolers, but most are still able to manipulate it. You won't be disappointed in this item.;5;11/28/2011 10:00
201766;Great!;This is a neat percussion effect. We have used it a lot with the younger ones. When things are being mixed or stirred in a story we are reading, when we need a cool sound effect for a transition, and so many more.<br /><br />It has proved to be very easy for the kids to play. The build quality seems alright. It probably would not stand up to a lot of dropping from higher heights, however because of the handle and proper classroom procedures, this is not a concern for me, nor a reason to advise against it.;5;11/21/2011 10:00
201767;Great size for younger students;My second graders want to play the gankogui but many of mine are large and heavy.  This fits the bill for us.;5;9/22/2011 10:00
201767;Great Choice For Elementary or MS World Drumming;Love the size, love the sturdiness of construction, and it sounds great!;5;10/24/2011 10:00
201867;Nice quality;I am happy with the Sabian finger cymbals, which sound much better than the least expensive pair, which is what I had before.  There is some kind of coating on it which makes it look off white, not bronze, but it doesn't seem to affect the quality of the sound.  The 4 star rating is because the finger holders were not fastened to the cymbals and came off.  Also the literature that comes with the product says that there is an extra set of finger holders which I didn't receive.;4;2/6/2012 10:00
201872;"Toca Freestyle SFDK-9RP 9"" Synergy Doumbek, Bali Red";This drum is a good size for younger elementary students and has a good tone.;5;3/20/2012 10:00
201874;Decent kid's percussion instrument;I was a little disappointed in the construction of this instrument. It seems a bit flimsier than I was expecting. It does produce two distinct sounds due to the different ridge patterns. I just hope it lasts a decent length of time with regular student use.;4;10/9/2011 10:00
201874;Quality has dropped - disappointed.;I have one which was purchased a few years ago that I really like so I ordered more. They have gotten flimsier and lack the black ring my original one has. Not as thick or shiny as before. The original feels like quality, this feels like a cheap toy.;3;2/19/2020 12:18
201875;Perfect drums for little hands!;I am so looking forward to using these drums in my new school!  I now have 4 nested sets.  For the price, these drums sound very good and the kids will have a blast playing them!;5;11/9/2011 10:00
201877;Well made product;The drum is well made and has a great sound. My students are 3rd, 4th and 5th graders and they all love to play this drum. Very reasonable price for hand drums and the colors really pop!;5;5/24/2012 10:00
201974;Spring Drum a Hit!;My kids absolutely love my spring drum. I have to keep it in a special place because it's one of the first choices when we do drum circles or when we pick out sound effects instruments. It's a great tool for timbre experimentation.;4;12/23/2011 10:00
202119;Excellent Item and Customer service!!!;This is my third time buying tambourines for the Dance Ministry. The quality of each tambourine is excellent. Thank you also for the fast service delivering the items. We will continue buying  our instruments form West Music!!!;5;3/27/2013 10:00
202210;Love it!!;These were even better than I expected. Got a mixture of colors and they are great quality!;5;3/28/2012 10:00
202210;love these;Sound Great. Size perfect for hands of our 1-5 age group. Great quality;5;1/22/2012 10:00
202214;Great for rhythm church like Arthur Hull does;These are really nice extended sounding chimes like the  pentatonic scale Suzuki Chimes, without the high cost. Bought two sets for a total of 16 chimes to spread around the circle.;5;9/3/2012 10:00
202214;GREAT tone;I discovered this set at a musical instrument exploration class for my young sons.  These chime bars were more durable than the expensive glockenspiels also in the room and the young children were really able to make music by following a color pattern.  I looked into the set and was happy to see it in this price range.  I've been using my set for over a year now with a church children's chorus, at home with family and even at summer camps.  They have great pitch, clear tone and are easy to use for children and adults alike.  And they are durable!  I also appreciate that they color coordinate with Boomwhackers.;5;9/1/2018 13:28
202297;rOverseas Connection G-872 Ghanaian Caxixi Straw Rattle;Very colorful, easy to play and adds an authentic look for African themed pieces.  My students are enjoying using these.;5;3/26/2012 10:00
202297;Kids love these;My students are in awe of the sound they produce. We all want to know what's inside. It's a very pleasing shaker sound IMHO.;5;10/8/2011 10:00
202376;The best shakers!;This brand is incredibly sturdy, and they have a great sound! The colors are vibrant, and the weight feels good in your hand when making music.;5;8/29/2012 10:00
202376;Great item;These are a great quality!  I would highly recommend.;5;10/30/2011 10:00
202376;Good Shaker;My elementary students loved the shakers. The colors were a big hit, and the egg was just the right size for my 5th and 6th graders to hold. (I have not used them with my younger students yet.) They have a good sound and volume for classroom use.;5;6/22/2012 10:00
202376;Awesome for littles!;"I love using egg shakers for littles, and these are an affordable option that come in fun colors. The sound of these egg shakers is very good--they don't ""sound cheap"" like some brands do. Thanks for having quality instruments for all ages!";5;6/1/2013 10:00
202376;Quality Change to this product;While I still purchase these shakers, I would like to note that they are now sealed at the small end with a cap and glue. The glue does not always hold.  Six shakers in my last order have failed due to this defect.  I use them with very young children (2-5) and consider this a serious problem.  I would gladly pay more not to have this happen.  Also it was not a problem with previous designs.;2;2/17/2020 12:51
202376;Egg shakers;Sturdy & reliable -- great sound!;5;9/27/2011 10:00
202376;Shaker Eggs;Good price, right size, sent in the bright colors I asked for....children loved using them... couldn't be better;5;12/5/2012 10:00
202376;Who doesn't love an egg shaker?;"I mean, really-- can you find someone who doesn't love an egg shaker?  These are great- and West was great about sending an assortment of colors: I got five of each when I ordered 25!



I have some LP eggs that my daughter received in an instrument set that I prefer since I can control the sound a bit better, but for an everyday, general music setting with the ""under 8"" crowd, these are just right!";5;5/18/2011 10:00
202376;Yay!;My students love it when I bring out the bucket of our egg shakers.  As much as my students love tossing them, or beating them on the floor (that they're told NOT to do!) I've never had one break.  And I agree with the other review--these don't sound like a cheap toy at all! My son has some from a drum instrument kit he got for Christmas, and these sound 100 times better.  They are one of my Kindergarten and 1st graders favorites!;5;5/15/2011 10:00
202376;Perfect for Everyone!;Who doesn't love an egg shaker? These are a must-have for anyone leading music groups! Their shape makes them easy to hold, the colors are fun, and they are very durable! They work for all ages, and they sound great!;5;7/21/2011 10:00
202376;Fun Colors!;I love the colors of these eggs--very fun and a good variety!  They have a nice sound and seem very solid for use in my Kindermusik class.;5;8/13/2011 10:00
202376;perfect!;"Perfect sound, perfect weight!  I have tried numerous other brands for my preschool music classes.  Other brands have cracked or discolored, or sound ""toy-ish"" and really rattly, or the beads inside are so light that you cannot get much sound variation other than rattle-rattle-rattle.  BASIC BEAT EGGS sound great and feel great, and hold up to lots of use!";5;8/6/2010 10:00
202376;Perfect for my class;These shakers are just the right size for my toddler class.  They have a great sound and come in a variety of wonderful colors!;5;7/16/2012 10:00
202376;Music Therapy Must;Perfect instrument for CP Music Therapy. Giving them as gifts to each of my son's classmates.;5;4/7/2013 10:00
202376;Great value for the price;Durable. Loud enough!  Small enough!;5;1/23/2012 10:00
202376;Egg-cellent;Purchased 22 of the eggshakers for my storytime group ages 0-2 years-old. They are perfect for little hands, not too heavy or light, great sound to shake along with songs may it while singing or playing CD-player. Very sturdy for children with tamper tantrums as well. Highly recommended!;5;2/10/2012 10:00
202377;Wonderful sound!;Chiquita shakers have a wonderful sound, are durable, and the handles are great! An amazing product that will last forever!;5;7/20/2011 10:00
202399;Has it's uses;"I got one of these earlier this year and I was a bit disappointed at first. The edge tones are pretty good, but striking the drum in the center just gave a flat ""whack"". I didn't really expect much low sound, but I can get a much better low tone from a simple hand drum. It has feet which help for my physically challenged students, but still not quite what I thought it would be.";3;8/24/2011 10:00
202410;Nice instrument, not really a xylophone;I have had this instrument in my classroom for a few years now. It has a nice sound, and it has held up well (the mallets, not so much). However, it's really not a xylophone. It's also not a metallophone. I'd classify it as somewhere in between. It's tone definitely rings longer than a wood bar, but not as long as a metal bar. As for value and adding instruments to a classroom, it's definitely a good purchase but if you are looking for a true xylophone tone, go with wood bars.;4;4/29/2013 10:00
202411;A Great Buy!;The Sonor Global Beat AX-GBF Fiberglass Alto Diatonic Xylophone was a great purchase when you need to add to the Orff instrumentarium but don't have a lot of money. It has characteristics of both a metallophone and a xylophone, with a very pleasing ring.;5;8/27/2011 10:00
202412;Excellent;this is an excellent quality instrument!;5;2/13/2012 10:00
202416;Lord of the Drums;This besuty has a rich sound and is eye candy for you audience, great combination!;5;10/11/2012 10:00
202422;Worth Every Penny;I bought this for my son for Christmas, and it has turned out to be one of my best investments for him to date.  He is developmentally disabled and loves music, so this drum has been perfect for him.  We sit around it and sing songs together.  I wish I would have bought one sooner.  You will not be disappointed.  The workmanship and quality are outstanding...overall a great, great drum!;5;1/1/2011 10:00
202430;Love it!;We purchased this instrument for our daughter. We love how easily she can grip the instrument and play it. I would think the bell would be a little muffled from it being inside the plastic case but it isn't. Highly recommend!;5;9/2/2012 10:00
202431;Rust concern;They look great and the handle is nice, but, because metal jingle bell is encased in plastic, it doesn't dry well and will rust after several washes.  I've had to take mine out of rotation.;2;8/28/2011 10:00
202432;Mesmerizing;Kids enjoy watching the beads as they fall to each tier. The Whirley spinner is fascinating to them.;5;12/23/2012 10:00
202450;shekere;works great- well made;5;8/25/2012 10:00
202541;Fun for everyone!;Bought for my almost 3 year old grandson. He loves it. Great sound and quality. The whole family is enjoying it. I expect it will last him a lifetime.;5;2/19/2013 10:00
202547;Be Aware of the Size;"This instrument is well made and sounds great, but I was a little surprised by the size.  Apparently the 7"" refers to the diameter (although mine is probably closer to nine inches), because the length is almost 20"" long!  Just something to be aware of, because the size could be hard for little hands to grasp.";4;6/5/2011 10:00
202548;"Overseas Connection G-521B 7 - 8"" Shekere";These shekeres are a good size, and colorful.  They make a good sound, not too loud for indoors.;5;3/21/2012 10:00
202548;My students love this!;The sound is good and my students love the brightly colored beads.;5;9/21/2011 10:00
202555;Great Drum!;Just what I hoped for!;5;3/12/2013 10:00
202555;This is every Drum Circle Facilitators first choice for a bass drum set.;For those of you who truly appreciate quality sound from their instruments you need to get the bass drum set.  I have in the past, in order to save money, used the large tom tom drums from a drum kit.  They are fine but do not compare to the construction of these drums that you lug around from drum circle to drum circle.   The lighweight Acousticon shell construction makes them very durable.  You never have to adjust the legs because they have none.  All three drums nestle into one another to make it easy transport.  I have, in the past, used black paper tape to cover my regular drumheads to try recreate what these Bahia Bass drumheads already do.  They eliminate the overtones that spoil the sound in a drum circle by lingering on.  These drums become an investment to your future.;5;10/24/2012 10:00
202777;Hand Held Tree Bell;I love this instrument.   It has beautiful tones when played.  It put a smile on all the kids who played it.;5;12/24/2011 10:00
202777;Love It!;This Bell Tree is the perfect size for an elementary music classroom, and much more affordable than the larger ones!;5;3/4/2012 10:00
202790;Mounted Castanets;This is so much easier to use in an elementary music classroom than the individual castanets.  It is very easily adjusted and tightened as well.;5;6/11/2012 10:00
202803;DrumYourDreams.Com facilators love their new drum;The drum is being used in drum circle events, both indoors and out.  It is being used on the Virginia Beach oceanfront in Full and New Moon circles.  It produces a great sound.  We have received many favorable comments regarding the robust sound that comes from it.  I look forward to purchasing the matching 14 and 12 inch drums from WestMusic in the future.;5;8/4/2012 10:00
202810;Canary Stick;My 5-month-old granddaughter loves playing with her new canary stick. It's soft and pliable so she doesn't hurt herself when waving it around to create its birdlike sounds.;5;5/31/2013 10:00
202810;Love them, but...;"I love these shakers! So do so many of the kids I work with (especially the Quack Stick - red ones). Very easy to play and clean. The only con I have experienced with these ones is that I have had them for a few weeks and with minimal use two out of the five are already broken. Something on the inside has popped loose and won't make the sound. I can fix them temporarily but the insides get shaken loose fairly quickly again.



Other than that, they are great";4;6/21/2011 10:00
202811;Great fun;My daughter is a music teacher at a new school, and discovered this in her new classroom.  I know she will enjoy them in the classroom, but now everyone in the family wants one.  We are looking forward to fun at Thanksgiving, with these gobble-makers!;5;10/17/2012 10:00
202811;quack stick;This is ideal for small kids.  The sound is so funny and cute.;5;3/30/2012 10:00
202863;So much fun;This excellent instrument is similar to a thunder tube, except it's all enclosed. It has an interesting sound that is popular with my young students. Remo instruments are always high quality and you won't be disappointed in your purchase.;5;11/29/2011 10:00
202863;Remo SR-2412-27 Didgeharp Shaker, Walkabout;This is a fun instrument, sounds a little like a digeridoo, but a lot easier to play! My students really liked it.;5;3/23/2012 10:00
202887;My favorite.;"I teach music for little ones, and found these to be an even better option than the Remo colorful nesting sound shapes.  8"", 10"" & 12"" are the perfect sizes.  Beautiful sound & feel, with the softer mallets, and very durable. Best of all - no more whining over colors & sizes, and no mallets in mouths! (unlike the tempting 'rainbow lollipop' mallets of the other set!).";5;8/7/2011 10:00
202908;My favorite;In orff I use them and I fell in love with these things!;5;6/18/2011 10:00
202908;Great for Kids!!;I am a music therapist and bought these to use with a young client. They have great sound and are made out of a silicone material that provides tactile stimulation along with the sound. I have a 8 month old son that also LOVES these. They are his favorite toy. I plan to buy several more sets for therapeutic uses and baby gifts!;5;5/1/2011 10:00
202908;Lots of Fun;"A friend of mine got these for my 6 month old daughter and she LOVES them.  Not only are they easy for her to grab and hold on to, she likes the sounds and is very pleased with herself as she's able to make them squeek.  And, as an added bonus, she likes to chew on them since she's teething ;-)



I'm ordering more.";5;4/25/2011 10:00
202914;High quality;This is a high quality item made in the USA. Chimes like this can be great for addressing environmental awareness, tracking and movement. They can be used to add sound effects to stories or as a musical reward. You won't be disappointed in this great item.;5;11/26/2011 10:00
203040;Great for Adaptive Use;I'm a music therapist and have clients with little or no grasping capabilities. I can attach these shakers to their fingers to offer them an opportunity to play along easily with the music. In some cases, I have used these with clients who were unable to handle any sort of physical or sensory stimulation provided by other instruments. The bands on these are loose enough for comfort but still stay in place, and all the client has to do is move their hands minimally to produce a sound. I also have clients who throw anything they pick up, but have tolerated these and gone on to participate.;5;8/19/2011 10:00
203254;WOWED!!!;OMGoodness!!! I was absolutely thrilled with the quality and workmanship of all 3 djembes!! They sound great too!! AND they were here right on time!!! Thank you! I love them!!!;5;4/30/2013 10:00
203574;Simply the best;We got a grant to purchase seven sets of these drums (to round out our set of 11 we already purchased from West). The product was delivered very quickly, were in perfect condition, and look and sound fantastic. They have a depth of tone that is easy for even the smallest children to produce. My students played these drums every day this school year and the drums look like they just came out of the boxes. The free shipping was a definite plus!;5;6/1/2018 12:17
203601;Lots of fun;Working well so far;5;8/2/2011 10:00
203603;For what it is, this is amazing!;"I bought this to be able to do Health Rhythms drum circles and to be able to throw a bunch of stuff over my back and jet to a party, etc with it anytime!!!!



This set is kick a__. It almost seems like it is endless. You start pulling drums out and they just never stop. I can't even tell you how many people have been like, ""You mean you put all that i that little bag!!!??"" Yep.



Also, these are good quality drums and percussion instruments. I think it is totally worth the money and more... great stuff. HIGHLY recommended. Sometimes I go to my drum circle and don't even bother bringing my djembes. I just grab this up. Fun stuff!!!!";5;10/2/2010 10:00
203610;Loud and Proud;Just got this drum and being new to djembe, the Apex delivers..Bass, Slaps, and Tonal Variation ability that makes it a joy to explore and play colorful rhythms and solos. It's Light, easy to keep looking and sounding good.If you play outdoors or in a drum circle...you will be heard..enjoy!;4;3/16/2012 10:00
203612;Awesome;My niece is a premie and will be celebrating her first birthday in February. I figured that this would be the best way to start her off with music and with her movement skills. She took to it like a fish in water. The smile on her face as she played and heard the music she was making was awesome.;5;9/19/2011 10:00
203739;the best Shekere ever;This is by far the best Shekere I have ever played, you have to try it to really know. I love it!;5;5/26/2011 10:00
203746;YES, great drum!;"I agree with Michele, this drum is brilliant. The FAT-ness of the head's construction gives it a soft, yet BIG attack. For such a reletivley smalll drum, this thing is a sound monster. What I found is, depending on where you smack it, there are many tones and sounds. When you find the ""sweet spot"" it actually is disconcerting, as the sound is so deep and big.



Amazing drum.

Makes a great BASS element in any drumming group... unless you have a whole bunch of people going wild, then maybe you want something with more shell in order to carry more volume.";5;4/30/2011 10:00
203746;Wonderful for Journeying;Nice full deep sound. Rope is slightly frayed so not sure how long it will hold up. Overall very happy with the drum.;5;8/18/2011 10:00
203746;Beautiful deep tone;This drum fully met my expectations.;5;5/28/2013 10:00
203746;Excellent value;"Well constructed, very durable. Big and boomy sound for its size. Play around and find the ""sweet spot."" Kids and teens love to play with it. They think it looks cool as well.";5;11/8/2012 10:00
203746;Remo Bass Buffalo Drum;Wonderful instrument with an incredible tone.;5;6/10/2012 10:00
203746;Beautiful vibrations;It has a powerful deep bass vibration that resonates for a good period of time. I took this to a couple drumming circles and it everyone loved it. A leader of one of the drumming circles liked it so much she asked me where I purchased it and bought one for herself.;5;7/11/2012 10:00
203746;Great Drum!;Love this buffalo drum. It creates a very deep tone with vibrations you can feel. As a therapist my clients love this drum. West Music is the best place to buy it too.;5;6/14/2012 10:00
203746;Deep sound;A fantastic drum, with a lot of variety of sounds. Of course, all sounds are bass and deep. A marvel. A ship that transports you beyond yourself.;5;6/24/2020 16:55
203746;Buffalo drum bass;I love this drum my friends also love it and want to purchase one. The price is great! The sound is so nice I love the bass.;5;4/5/2013 10:00
203746;Durable, deep-sounding drum;This drum's shell and head construction seem very strong and produce a deep, satisfying sound. In order to improve the sound, dampen the head to accentuate low tones and use a heavier mallet.;5;9/29/2011 10:00
203746;Must be felt - not just heard!;After testing a number of drums at Remo - ranging from Shapes and Frame Drums to Sound makers - This Drum stopped me in my tracks! The Pure tone of the Bahia Bass head, coupled with the sharp looking texture of the black earth frame - made it a must have for me!;5;4/5/2011 10:00
203746;Bahia Buffalo Drum;Lovely tone, well made, and durable!;5;8/6/2012 10:00
203746;Buffalos Bass drum;Oh I love the sound of this bass drum!;5;3/18/2013 10:00
203761;Fun percussion instrument;My clients love this instrument for the fun sounds it makes, interesting look and all the different ways it can be played. Easy to play too!;5;9/12/2012 10:00
203761;Better than expected!;At such a reasonable price, I had low expectations for the quality of this little instrument.  It was delivered promptly, was of much better quality than expected, and made a great stocking stuffer for our Music Director!;5;3/4/2013 10:00
203761;Two Tone Agogo;Nice instrument -- the two tones worked great for what we needed.;5;1/2/2012 10:00
203761;Two tone agogo;Awesome!  Nice tone!;5;1/4/2012 10:00
203761;Great sound;This agogo has a great sound and seems pretty sturdy for getting a lot of usage.  It is a bit bulky to do fast sounds with it but I guess I just need more practice.;5;5/21/2013 10:00
203761;Great construction!;I was quite surprised by the quality of this instrument. It's beautiful to look at and has a great sound. It seems very sturdy. What a great buy!;5;10/10/2011 10:00
203762;Single Bell Jingle sound is just right for my needs;The sound of the bell is great for a large class.  I've had other bells that are so shrill that with 24 pairs (kids and adults) all playing at once it was way too much.  These are just what I was looking for.;5;9/23/2019 14:05
203763;good quality and sound;We bought several for our playgroup of 0-5 year olds.  They are a perfect size for this age group and the bell sounds are strong and clear. We will get a great deal of use out of these.;5;1/20/2012 10:00
203763;Great!;Great quality and fast shipping!;5;12/4/2011 10:00
203763;5 sleigh bell on the handle;The kids loved the musical instrument;5;5/4/2013 10:00
203763;Buying more;Bought these for holidays and have enjoyed their sound.  Very nice wooden handle that allows students to be in better control of the beat.  Good value for price;5;6/6/2011 10:00
203764;Sturdy blocks;Well these seem nice and sturdy and add a unique sound to our shakers and scrapers collection. The kids enjoy them too!;5;10/12/2011 10:00
203766;Guiro Crow Sounder;Very nice Guiro and rich wood block sound.  The handles make it easy for young players to hold and play. For the money, this is a sturdy and versitile classroom instrument.;4;5/8/2011 10:00
203766;Check for flaws;The one I received was defective as the side slits were cut wrong. West was quick to respond and send out a replacement (which was appreciated!).;4;10/11/2011 10:00
203766;PS/PK students love them!;As a preschool music teacher, I am constantly stretching my budget to give the best quality experience.  After purchasing a few crow sounders last year, I have come back to fill out my basket so that all the class can have one at the same time.  They love the versatility of the sounds they can make with this guiro.  These instruments have been sturdy enough for my 2 1/2 - 5 year old students to use respectfully.  However, I would not recommend them for toddler classes as they might easily crack if thrown or stepped on.  But for my purposes, great instrument at a great value.;4;3/9/2012 10:00
203769;CASTANETS WOW;have searched all over and purchased many. however Basic Beat Castanets on a handle are by far the very best very easy to play keep a good snappy beat. WONDERFULL;5;2/12/2012 10:00
203770;Castinets;Very efficient;5;10/30/2012 10:00
203786;Good Glock;This model of the Alto Glockenspiel is suitable for classroom use.  I was just expecting a larger sound and more pure tone ring.;4;12/15/2012 10:00
203811;Baby maracas;Very pretty. Sound pretty good;5;5/23/2012 10:00
203811;Sound great and good size for small hands;Great quality.  Used successfully in our group of 0-5 year olds. The younger ones especially liked these light weight, great sounding, instruments.;5;1/19/2012 10:00
203811;Maracas;The maracas are 5 inches long. We like the maracas when working with infants and toddlers  who are blind or have low vision.  The two colors are not overwhelming and offer visual contrast.  The maracas are fairly light so little hands can hold them.;5;7/15/2011 10:00
203875;Durable;So far so good. I play very hard and the tambourine is still holding up.;5;1/3/2012 10:00
203878;Excellent product;Excellent product, fast shipping, very satisfied;5;7/7/2012 10:00
203878;Great sound;As a music therapist, I highly recommend this tambouring! Clients love it!;5;12/22/2011 10:00
203882;Perfect;These are great sounding bongo drums. I really like how light they are. And the size is perfect.;5;9/13/2018 13:29
203886;Very durable drums;I bought three sets of drums (9 drums), one set had manufacturing defects and West Music has given me excellent service in replacing them.  The other two sets I have been using with my classes of young children.  The children have loved them and they have shown that they are very durable.  A couple of times drums were accidentally dropped and you would never know it.  I like how the drums are different sizes producing different tones.;5;1/7/2013 10:00
203886;Drums for PK classes;"This was a fantastic buy.  The PK-3 class is singing ""Ants Go Marching"" and will use the drums to play the boom, boom, boom at the end of each verse with these drums.  Just the right size for their little hands.";5;5/22/2012 10:00
204005;Unique for the classroom;My students are fascinated with this latest addition to our set of classroom instruments!  It is a neat way for me to expose them to music and instruments from a different part of the world.  The stand is easy to assemble, but it is not quite as solid of a base as I would like.;4;5/13/2011 10:00
204042;Shaker to the next level!;"This new shaker breaks all the old standards.

It not only can perform precision control

but can also achieve complex rhythms by

playing with lateral, circular and arc motion combinations. No other shaker has ever been able to syncopate 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32 combinations. How cool is that? Worth learning the tricks. Look for advanced demonstration videos on YouTube at QubeTubeTV.

204120;Great;This is a great little tambourine for group instrument playing. It's not too loud, so it won't drown out other instruments.;5;11/30/2011 10:00
204128;Yup!;These are great little claves. Simple, affordable, good sound.;5;7/11/2011 10:00
204133;Basic Beat BBC01 Plastic Finger Castanets;"My young students have a hard time remembering ""Castanets"" and when they first seem them, call them ""clappers,"" or ""seashells.""  I love the bright colors, and my students love having one in each hand to dance with while they play.";5;5/16/2011 10:00
204133;simply fun!;I have these mixed in with other simple percussion for jamming with my daughter.  The sound is bright and although I need to tighten the elastic every once in a while, it's easy to tighten them right up.;5;5/19/2011 10:00
204133;Great price, easy to use;Excellent price and easy for children to handle.;5;1/8/2013 10:00
204133;Castanets are great!;These castanets are a great addition to our therapy instrument collection. They have a unique sound and are excellent for addressing fine motor skills.;5;12/1/2011 10:00
204133;When you need a castanet sound but don't play castanets....;The plastic castanets have a great sound but are really easy to play.  I use them for a number of the songs our band does.  The audience loves the quirkiness.;5;10/29/2011 10:00
204134;Castanets;Nice sound for kids ears. Built well. I'm always looking for solid instruments that have a relatively mellow sound, so that kids can sing and play at the same time. Thanks.;5;1/25/2012 10:00
204134;They can take a lickin' and keep on clickin'!;I use these castanets frequently with my students (ages 6-21). The kids are very hard on instruments and I have found that these stand up to the challenge. The only part that I've had trouble with is the plastic cable tie that holds the red parts to the handle. I got a pack of 100 replacement cable ties at the hardware store for just a few dollars, and now I'm able to repair them quickly and easily!;5;7/22/2011 10:00
204139;Cheap Maracas - Don't Waste Your Money;"I would not recommend these maracas. They are made from cheaper plastic than previous models I have purchased from West Music and break easily. I work with individuals who have developmental disabilities who range in age from 3 to adult. Some individuals like to tap their maracas together during a song. These maracas cracked and broke very quickly the first time they were used.  I have used the Hohner mini maracas for 4 years and they are still going strong.  I don't know why West Music switched to this shoddy brand.   They were kind enough to replace one pair which broke after the first time they were used; however, the others that I purchased have scratches all over them.  Basically, I can't use this brand with my clients. I would give no stars if that was possible.";1;8/30/2011 10:00
204139;My go-to for value maracas;I have used these for severals years in my music therapy practice with patients who have dementia. They are sturdy, light but not flimsy, and have just the right amount of sound.;4;9/2/2019 17:58
204141;Perfect instrument for little hands;I can give all 19 students in a class one of these and we can play along to songs without it being too loud. Great for pre-K and kindergarteners to experiment with different ways to make a sound - shake tap or scrape!;5;9/5/2018 21:37
204142;Great for younger students!;I really like this chime tree!  It's perfect for my younger students who don't need the larger size, and I love the portability and the fact that it can be set on the floor and students can play it sitting down!;5;7/1/2012 10:00
204144;bringin' folksy back!;My students love these spoons! The metal parts bend when pulled, but they have endured much bending and haven't broken or snapped yet!  They seem to be very sturdy and provide a great opportunity to discuss folk instruments. Wonderful!;5;7/5/2011 10:00
204152;Excellent!;This set of instruments is perfect for my 0-4 year old music class!;5;7/12/2012 10:00
204155;durable and affordable;I appreciate that Basic Beat and Westmusic offer quality instruments at an affordable price.;5;12/21/2011 10:00
204155;Dashing through the snow...;"It was time to replace my falling apart jingle bells and these are perfect. They're durable and have a pleasing tone. Get a class set and, ""let it snow, let it snow, let it snow...""";5;10/13/2011 10:00
204156;Jingle Bells Review;These jingle bells exceed my expectations. They create a beautiful sound that is crisp and clear. The jingle bells are made to last. I hope this is a purchase I can use for the next 20 years with my students. The handles are wide enough for my first graders to grip and wide enough for my sixth graders. Wonderful product that I will buy again.;5;2/3/2013 10:00
204158;Great Quality For Music Classroom;I purchased 2 of these for my elementary music classroom.  We do a lot of World Drumming.  These agogo bells have a nice sound quality, and the construction is solid.  I am very pleased with the purchase.;5;12/14/2011 10:00
204197;Excellent!;Nice surprise to find good quality wood and sound.;5;7/18/2012 10:00
204197;Tone/Slit Drum;"This is a great little drum to introduce tone/slit drums to students.  The children are able to hear the difference in tone according to the ""tongue"" played and distinguish the subtle high/low pitches.  The ""on sale"" price and free shipping made this an unbeatable value!";5;6/2/2011 10:00
204197;Slit Drum;Love this slit drum!  It is a great size for the earlychildhood and young elementary age clients I work with in music therapy.  This instrument is a super addition to my tone blocks, but has more versatility.;5;7/9/2011 10:00
204198;Must have handbells;These are very useful in the classroom and work like a charm with my special needs class as they make joyful music!;5;12/28/2012 10:00
204346;Check the size;I ended up returning this product because it was too large for the music therapy clients I work with to handle. Still a good instrument though.;4;9/11/2012 10:00
204376;Poor construction;I was unhappy with the construction of the instrument. It arrives unassembled and keeps falling off the handle/stick when used by students. I will try wood glue. The block itself has an okay tone but is not the nice smooth and varnished one pictured.;1;9/8/2011 10:00
204379;Westco Cowbell;Perfect for small, elementary student hands with authentic sound!;5;4/13/2013 10:00
204380;Gift purchase;I purchased this item as part of a fundraiser for a private Christian school.  The music teacher had selected this as an item needed in their classroom.  She was thrilled to get it and said it is the perfect instrument for the children (regardless of age).;5;5/22/2013 10:00
204380;Excellent drum;High quality. Well done and the sound/acoustic of the drum is amazing;5;1/26/2013 10:00
204409;Good tone;I bought this toy slit drum and the other one made by Horner, and I feel this drum has best the sound out of the two. It has a more pure tone with some depth.;5;5/11/2012 10:00
204432;Westco Bag of Rhythm Kit;my two year old granddaughter loved everyhing!  She's too young for the kazoos which I actually felt were a lesser quality the other items are.  Still a good value for the price.;5;3/31/2012 10:00
204463;Table Top Steel Drum Kit - best family gift EVER!;Purchased this steel drum as a gift for my 34-year old son, at his request. It was an immediate hit with him and his whole family. Even the 5-year old has learned to play the songs supplied in the directions! The instrument's tone is surprisingly melodic (not tinny), the mallets supplied work perfectly and the note markers on the head are very easy to read. Wonderful investment that has yielded quality time together for this family.;5;5/29/2012 10:00
204464;beautiful sound;I absolutely love this little drum. Great sound and easy to set up.  I teach preschool, and kids are instantly attracted to it for its size, color and as soon as you play for its sound. It's easy to learn, and easy to play. Very enjoyable instrument overall.;5;6/8/2013 10:00
204480;Remo Versa Drum Sample Package;I love the sound of the drums and the portability!;5;5/2/2012 10:00
204490;Was purchased as a gift for a very good friend;All I've heard is heaps of praise for this item. The person who received it told me it made their rather bad year end on a very excellent and uplifting note!;5;3/1/2013 10:00
204509;Acousti-Blox;I love the sound and durability of the Acousti-Blox.  It had a nice sound that cuts through a large group.  I definitely prefer the Acousti-Blox sound over a cowbell.;5;6/9/2013 10:00
204534;Excellent first instrument;We purchased this for my toddler. It’s tuned well. Loud though. The mallet is painted and the paint did chip when we teethed on it. I just used a baby food spoon in its place.;5;5/15/2019 20:17
204550;Just what Grandpa ordered.;We ordered a number of small percussion instruments to be delivered for a 2 year old grand-daughter's birthday. We got to watch the opening via internet and they were all very enthusiastically received.;5;8/15/2012 10:00
204552;Intriguing rhythm instrument;This is a favorite in my bag of instruments, unlike the usual assortment of tambourines, maracas and egg shakers. I perform with kids and share this bag with them. They naturally gravitate towards the bright colors, the novelty and mystery of how it makes sound and its pleasant tone. It stands up to abuse, as well. I will purchase more.;5;1/26/2012 10:00
204576;Instead of drum sticks!;I teach Drums Alive. I also have the Rhythm Pals. These are a fun alternative to Drumsticks. Students can also drum on the floor, tables, etc. my adults had a blast with these.;5;5/29/2013 10:00
204576;BoomWhackers;These boomwhackers work great as drumsticks.  They are very well made and durable.  Drum sticks are fun to use, but can potentially leave blisters.  So, I am happy to have a nice set of boomwhackers for my younger students!;5;4/16/2018 10:00
204616;Study and fun;Our group loved these, but work best when using the mallet.  We will be ordering other small drums that can be played with hands.  These are easy to carry and the colors and shapes will be great for developing learning activities. They are study and will take abuse of our 0-5 age group.;4;1/17/2012 10:00
204754;These Work For Us!;"I have used this glockenspiel in my K-5 classroom for six years now.  This has been a good low-budget barred instrument for us.  The mallets work well and have held up well.  The soft prongs that hold the bars on are quite sturdy – with a good amount of care, none of them have broken.  Some kids prefer to remove the bars they are not playing; and sometimes I have removed the bars for them.  They sound fine, but too ""clicky"" for a performance.  I appreciate that they aren’t overly loud when the whole class plays together.";5;11/17/2012 10:00
204757;Ocean Disc;I bought this for a little boy age 9, who is blind from being a shaken baby at 3 weeks of age. He loves percussion instruments and drums and since he is blind, needs help with grasping/ spatial skills. He loves this disc and started playing it right away for some of our songs we are learning.;5;7/31/2012 10:00
204757;Too much Treble;"I took out the beads and used it empty as a regular drum.
Just found it extra trebley!  A personal issue, yes, but I bought two and barely use them.";3;1/30/2020 10:18
204759;Timber T-18 Drum;This drum far surpassed my expectations. My kids loved using it as soon as I opened the box. I will definitely order this brand of drum again aswell as more from this company;5;1/11/2012 10:00
204784;paddle drum and mallets;The paddle drum has a tinny like sound to it.;5;9/1/2012 10:00
204786;More Than Meets The Eye;It's impossible to realize how much paddle drums can supercharge the energy in a room until you use them. I have found that they invariably get tired, non-participatory STAFF moving and laughing in no time. They are magical!;5;6/15/2011 10:00
204786;Always good quality;Remo makes great products, including these paddle drums. This set is a good value and a great way to start a collection. This set includes quality mallets and a key to adjust the tuning. You can't go wrong with Remo products.;5;11/24/2011 10:00
204790;Little drummer girl approves;The beginner drum set is fun for parents and kids alike. It is lightweight but sturdy enough for some energetic drumming. The drums come out of the wood base so it doesn't really sit on one's lap that well. When you set it over your lap the drums are pushed up and out. However, it fits on our high-chair tray quite well.;5;5/28/2012 10:00
204796;Perfect for Our Students;This was the perfect item to help get our percussion class started for our special needs students.  They love it and we are all having a great time making music together.;5;11/9/2012 10:00
204871;So neat!;This looks great on my coffee table.  This PLAYS great when I do drumming.  AND it is beautiful.  I really like the tiny size and the big sound.;5;4/7/2012 10:00
204897;Cool!;These drums are fun, “ basset” and easy to store. My students are really enjoying playing them in our music class!;5;3/30/2013 10:00
204923;"Hohner HO359DB Tactile Single Egg Shaker; Various Colors";these shakers are light weight yet sturdy and very attractive with the various colors they come in! The kids LOVE the tactile stimulation!;5;4/29/2012 10:00
204923;Well made!;"My one year old loves these! Great ""toy"" for learning rhythm.";5;4/23/2012 10:00
205014;Remo AG-2056-71 agogo;I bought this product years ago, it has a very nice sound, it's a high quality instrument and the weather's changing conditions didn't effect the sound even though it has a skin head not plastic one.;5;4/6/2019 22:21
205036;Exactly as advertised;I wanted some durable rhythm sticks for a collaboration with the PE teacher, and these fit the bill. Sturdy, plastic, and exactly what we wanted.;5;5/4/2012 10:00
205078;Great prop;The sound is beautiful and enchanting and goes very well with pretty much any good children song. It is a fun prop to play with and a great tool for musical development. They are not too heavy so little hands can handle them. No little parts coming off or anything I need to be worrying about during classes.;5;5/20/2013 10:00
205084;review- Hainen;Perfect set of sound shapes!  I love the colors, not just because they are beautiful, but because you can call our different sections in your classroom or group.  Essential for the classroom! :);5;8/13/2019 16:05
205104;Perfect size for our group;This drum is a good size, as we are a nomadic group.  We are sometimes outside at the park and at others in various indoor locations.  Our group is mostly 0-5 year olds.  The drum is big enough and sturdy enough for the smaller children to lay on and feel the beat.  2-3 children can play at the same time.  It was well loved at our introduction event.  I think it will last us many years.;5;1/16/2012 10:00
205105;Palm Tambourine is durable enough to play with drum sticks.;I was looking for tambourines to use with my crash cans (Artie Almeida) and saw the palm tambourine. My students will be playing them with drum sticks and they are just the right size to fit in the crash cans. The price is fabulous too.;5;11/19/2012 10:00
205132;cleanable rhythm sticks;My rhythm sticks get nicks and I have individuals who put them in their mouths.  These sound good and are washable and cleanable.  So far, my individuals like them.;5;3/21/2013 10:00
205132;No more splitting;Love these plastic sticks! My wooden sticks would often split and I couldn’t use them.  The red plastic sticks have a good sound and shouldn’t split.;5;12/22/2012 10:00
205178;Great set;One stop shop right in this set for your Cardio Drumming needs. I was skeptical with this great price but it's a good sturdy bucket, ball and drum sticks.;5;5/1/2020 20:54
205188;Excellent sound.;These drum lids are perfect for classroom music with a very pleasant mature sound. Can be used on desk top or placed over a 5 gallon pail. Great for use with special needs kids needing physical adaption as well as playing in typical settings. Mature sounding drum instruments can be played with stick or by hand. I had 14 in my last program. Rebuilding my stock in my new venture.;5;11/23/2018 15:20
205226;CajonTab;This is an amazingly musical instrument easy to play and fun. I have two and they complement each other. If you can afford the small and large one? Get them!;5;7/19/2019 15:02
205315;New Favorites for My Fleet;I'm a full time drum circle facilitator and the new Festival line from Remo are fantastic.  Lightweight, stacking, and easy to sanitize make them wonderful for me to use.  Great look, feel and sound make them wonderful for my clients to play.  I recommended adding a strap so that the three drums can be linked and transported more readily.;5;11/7/2018 14:44
205386;great;i love it;5;4/14/2020 10:09
205535;Very Nice Drums;"I'm very pleased with this order. I'm in love with the sound and can't stop playing the 12"" and 14"" drums. The 10"" one has been a bit difficult for me and I haven't found the right way to hold it, but getting these has been worth it The shipping was fast and they arrived safely. Totally recommend!";5;3/29/2021 21:36
212608;Korogi EKO32;This is the best, cheapest beginner unit that I have found on the market.  We have moved our 5th graders to this instrument across the whole district.  The bar response is closer to a full sized instrument and the sound is far superior to a steel bell set.;5;4/19/2011 10:00
215240;Best cymbal I've ever played!;This cymbal is so incredibly versatile. The bell has a rich, full sound. Move down the cymbal about two inches, and you have a GREAT medium dry ride sound. Move down towards the lathed edge, and you have a beautiful crash sound that also can be used as a wet ride. I, in my 10 years as a professional percussionist, have NEVER been as impressed with any other cymbal. Buy it!;5;4/29/2011 10:00
217497;Sweet;I been drumming since late 60s and all my equipment Ive keep in good order and been the only owner . I have Zildjian Ks from 1968 , a 20 in med 14 in hats and a K Zil Constantanople 20 in . i wanted to add a 16 & 18 to the set and tried these . was a little leary , but to my suprise these really rocked and sounded tuned with my set . Since then their my 2 go to cymbals and been on stage a few times now , never a complaint and never have a problem with untuned/unmatched drum set & cymbals ... Try them , you will be suprised . Sal , Drummer for original late 70s E X I T ,& Studio Fill Ins ( no credits ).ENJOY !;5;10/18/2019 13:12
250922;excellent!;This bag is a safe, snug fit! Very sturdy!  The straps are a little long and may seem awkward on a short frame, but you can't beat the quality of this case!;4;7/6/2011 10:00
250941;Frame drum bag;Good bag for the price, holds several frame drums comfortably.;5;8/7/2012 10:00
250941;Love my drum;Have had other drums, but this one is the best.;5;6/5/2012 10:00
250942;great bag, very useful;great for organizing and store our drum circle percussion items. mesh pockets/dividers inside are very versatile.  the padding is not that thick, but adequate.  love the little window where I put a picture/list of items so kids can help put the correct items back. I love Basic Beat bags. We have many different kinds of bags from this line. If I had a store, I'd definitely sell these! Proud to be a user! I l researched on long for a long time to find bags for my drum circle gears, and so happy to find Basic Beat bags at West Music.;5;1/2/2013 10:00
250943;great design, great value;These bags are awesome. Compartments on the inside are ver useful.  A little pocket in the front allows us to put a list or pictures of content or name card.  So glad I found it at West Music. The entire line of Basic Beat bag are awesome.;5;12/31/2012 10:00
250957;Spacious Bag;This bag is perfect for holding everything I need for gig. Its also great for organizing all my tambourines, castinets, and triangles.;5;4/22/2011 10:00
251341;Best bag ever!;This really is the best bag. Nothing gets crammed or is in risk of getting broken. I have mallets and sticks in my bag and it really is the best! The only thing that bugs me is I never know what side to open, so I open both sides, but that's just me.;5;4/10/2011 10:00
251497;Padded Trap Table;I have so many percussion gears, really difficult to place them and have easy access to grab and play. Luckily I have one of these, Sabian 61138 Tom Gauger Stand Pad, to help me out. Just provide a standard large music stand put on the pad and voila. It fits and velcro-ed so you won't miss and slip the mallets away.;5;3/15/2012 10:00
251594;excellent product;Very good construction, good padding. highly recommended.Great companion to Sound Shape. Now we are read to go anywhere!;5;1/1/2013 10:00
251594;Drum carry bag...;It’s a double carry bag for my buffalo drums. I love it because it carries two!;5;4/6/2013 10:00
251630;Clave Companion;"This seemingly simple tool is more than a ""companion"" - it is truly the ""partner"" that young claves players need!  No more dropped instruments, dull-sounding tones, yelps (from accidentally hitting fingers instead of the clave), or frustration from players who just can't seem to find the correct position to hold a pair of claves.  It fits perfectly in the hand, and does exactly what the description says - offers the ability to produce a pure resonance with ease.";5;7/10/2011 10:00
251962;Very useful;My Ludwig conga was up on a stand that made it too high for my elementary students.  This set of rubber feet brought it down to a playable level and allowed some space to let the sound out. They make the conga just the slightest bit wobbly, though.  That's why four stars instead of five.;4;7/16/2011 10:00
252362;Roc n Soc Bracket complete;Excellent phone support prior to purchase to tell me idem comes with bolts (as was not pictured) Bracket arrived complete with hardware.;5;3/14/2013 10:00

I was a little spectacle at first never have dealt with you company and had been taken by others online in the past so you cant blame me I was a little leary, but I am happy with not only the skin but the professional manner in which my order was looked at and taken care of ...........Thank you so very much......and I know if I have any problems I can contact you with ease. Happy Holidays and I will refer you to musicians I know .......Thanks again!;5;1/21/2013 10:00
253394;remo Black max 13 inch snare head;Excellent sound. We are a marching drum line and this really improved the overall sound of our snare drums. So far the seem to hold up well.;5;6/30/2012 10:00
253916;Great Mallets;These mallets produce a bright tone that is great for my percussion ensemble. They are easy to clean, and easy to use! Great mallets!;5;10/27/2012 10:00
253916;Great for Fiberglass Bass Xylophones;I was not pleased with the sound of my fiberglass xylophones, but these mallets give a much fuller and more focused sound.;5;8/20/2012 10:00
253921;Worth Every Penny;I'm an elementary music educator in Tampa, FL, and I discovered this mallet at the American Drum booth at our state convention.  I immediately purchased two for use with the set of contra bass bars in my classroom as well as with the  CBBs being played in our district's Honors Mallet Percussion ensemble, which I was conducting that year.  They have a noticeably more clear attack than the large red, orange, or white yarn mallets typically used.  Several of my colleagues heard them and purchased a pair for their own classrooms.  I highly recommend this mallet!;5;1/25/2019 15:11
254450;bell tree mallets;These mallets are perfect for bell trees.;5;5/3/2012 10:00
254714;General Mallets;It is a good option to a starter percussionist, nice articulation but not too much.;5;6/23/2012 10:00
254715;Very hard mallet;This is not a heavy mallets but with weight enough. This is VERY articulated, if you look for something that cuts, it would be a good choice. Seriously, there is a huge difference between medium and hard...  it is very hard.;4;6/24/2012 10:00
254763;Best Mallets!;Great mallets for xylos!  Would highly recommend them for a great sound!;5;12/14/2012 10:00
254788;Great Talking Drum Mallet for several reasons;This is a great talking drum mallet! It's longer then the wooden ones available which allows me more control. It's precise when ordering two they match in everyway. Some of the wooden ones from other sources are each different, one short one long, that isn't the case with these. Plus they have that wonderful handle grip that allows full comfortable control. Highly recommended for not only the talking drums but also Djun Djun drums and others!!!;5;9/30/2011 10:00
255128;Love it!;It seems very sturdy.  Can't wait to try it out in my toddler class!;5;7/14/2012 10:00
255128;parachute;Our music teachers are so excited to use the new parachute in class this coming fall. Their smiles tell it all.;5;11/2/2011 10:00
255131;Easy to use;These pins worked great to replace my old broken pins. My glockenspiel works like new!;5;12/21/2012 10:00
255135;a must have;This is an essential item if you have the Studio 49 series.  Even though my students use the instruments with extra care, everyday use can cause the pins to loosen and come out.  We misplaced a few rubber pins, but with this purchase I am able to have extras on hand. Shipment was fast and I had what I needed days before our performance!;5;5/18/2018 12:39
255321;Great Overall;I think that the idea of a dual-sided pad is awesome for those who are constantly practicing in different places, allowing silent, and strenuous practice for wherever you are, all in one pad. the six-inch pad is also very helpful, allowing more portability;4;3/7/2011 10:00
255381;versatile;This shaker/pick combo is great because it can be held two ways and still functions!  Great for clients with limited grasp.  Lightweight but durable.;5;7/7/2011 10:00
255448;Basic Beat Bongo Stand;Very sturdy.  I was able to adapt it for use with Remo Bongos as well.;5;6/9/2012 10:00
255644;Great for long-term care!;This stand has made it possible for the older adults in my facility to enjoy making music with our djembes! It puts the drum at just the right height so that my clients can reach the drum and get a great sound. Since most of my clients are in a wheelchair, or do not have the leg strength to hold the drum, this is the perfect alternative to offer any music therapy recipient, drum circle participant, or any one who wants to effectively use more than one djembe at a time for a performance. Great and thoughtful product!;5;5/22/2011 10:00
255730;Light jazz stick;These sticks feel really nice for light jazz playing, they feel like you've got nothing in your hands. The one part that makes them a little annoying is that the tips break down fairly easily. After playing for a couple weeks, the tips start to wear down. A great feel though!;4;4/19/2011 10:00
255804;Awesome!!!;I rated this pair 5 stars because these are really nice. They have an awesome bead and feel great with the hands. Out of Vic Firth's collection, these have to be very close to the top. You won't regret buying these!;5;4/20/2011 10:00
255923;Vic Firth 5A;Iâ€™ve had these sticks for a couple of years. They have good workmanship (no chipping like my previous â€œplywoodâ€ sticks) and they have a good balance. These sticks are versatile, which is a good for me, as I play a variety of styles. Note that I do not play very hard with my sticks, so if you play a lot of hard rock or metal these sticks will wear out more quickly than mine. These sticks have a good balance, and play well. I prefer 7As for quick articulation, but thatâ€™s just personal preference. Good sticks at a good price.;5;6/19/2011 10:00
256024;LOVE THIS PRODUCT!;Perfect for multi-setups and pit work!  Wish I bought one long ago...you'll LOVE this simple double triangle mount!;5;1/24/2011 10:00
256782;Vic Firth CKBAG Concert Keyboard Mallet Bag;This mallet bag works wonders. All the sticks i need for any application i can carry it in this bag. It holds the sticks and mallets securely and safe. The extra side pockets are perfect for drumkeys and tape or any accesories i need.;5;4/28/2011 10:00
257507;Quality instrument, but very large and too loud;I ended up returning these maracas because they were too large and loud for the clients I work with. They seemed to be high quality and durable though.;4;9/13/2012 10:00
257885;Beautiful basket!;I absolutely love this basket! It is beautiful in color and is larger than what I expected. It is perfect for carrying various instruments, props, etc. in the classroom or for programs.;5;2/22/2012 10:00
257885;Overseas conection market basket;Beautiful construction, original design. It is an unbelievable bargain and very useful in a music room to store authentic percussion;5;2/10/2011 10:00
258482;noway;awesome;5;3/6/2011 10:00
258591;Best 26” Gong Stand For The Money;I searched the Internet for a quality stand for my 26” Paiste. The. Chronos was affordable and sturdy enough to meet my needs. It arrived within the time specified.;5;2/18/2013 10:00
258643;Excellent value. Great product and great price;The Basic Beat bags are my favorite for drum and percussion storage.  (We have several different kinds). The construction and material are excellent.  Good padded on each end.  I bought a Meinl VivaRhythm Bass drum and didn't want to spend  $50 on a bag for it. I have one of these BB1627 for some Versa drums and I tried it. It fits very well.  BB1628 is an excellent and versatile bag. Just love it.  We use Basic Beat bags for our various drum circle items. Adults and kids love them, and they are very easy to use and very durable.;5;12/30/2012 10:00
258643;drum bag;Fits perfectly, and looks great;5;1/11/2013 10:00
258733;Everything and more...;I was so pleasantly surprised by the rich deep sound that this head produced.  I also swapped out my other conga heads with this style of Fiberskyn.  Westmusic delivered fast and the head was packaged very well for protection.  I highly recommend this head.;5;2/2/2012 10:00
259322;Great stand, great condition;The stand arrived very quickly and in great condition. Every works just as I had expected it to. While I personally don't love the Yamaha/Randall May cup/rail design, it's very functional and I'm happy with my purchase.;5;6/1/2018 12:23
259409;multi-drum bag.;I use this to carry my riq, pandiero and kanjira.  the only thing that would be nice is another pocket just for tuning keys.;5;8/12/2012 10:00
259587;orff table stands;Perfect for my orff instruments.;5;7/17/2012 10:00
259587;Great product. Only one complaint;The stand is great, and easy to assemble. The only thing is that I wish the stands were collapsible for better storage when not in use. They take up a lot of space if your room and/or closet is small.;4;11/19/2019 9:04
259587;Easy to assemble;Really like this table. So easy to put together!;5;3/28/2013 10:00
259587;Easy Setup;Sets up in minutes. Able to fit two glockenspiel. Also able to fit one soprano/alto xylophone.;5;7/26/2012 10:00
259915;GREATEST PAD EVER;i used to be in orchestra and then i heard about this pad and i got it with some system blue dc50's marching sticks and it helped me a lot. When i was a freshman i made 3rd snare out of 8 and now as a sophomore i am center and most of the guys/girls are older than me but they use vic firth stuff idk if it helps them better but im lead snare so that's all i care about;5;10/7/2010 10:00
259915;It's No Exaggeration, THE BEST PAD IN THE WORLD!;"This pad definitely avoids those pad-hands, and at the same time build your chops tremendously!

NOTE: Apply the turtle wax (which is included) every now and then, it helps preserve the life and sexy-look of the pad!";5;5/9/2011 10:00
259915;Best Pad in the Market;This has to be the greatest pad ever. Give you a great feel for an actual drum and the rims are fantastic. The only down sides are that it is loud (for a pad) and you have to apply turtle wax on it now then to keep it clean, protected, and keep it from sticking to surfaces.;5;4/21/2011 10:00
260087;Very versatile cart;I needed some carts for my hodgepodge of instruments and ran across this one.  I ordered 1 just to see how it worked.  I loved it so much that I immediately ordered a second one.  Now I'm looking at what's left in my budget to see if I can get 1 or 2 more.  I love that they work with all of my different brands (I have to change the set up for some brands, but that's easy enough).  The push button height adjustment takes the guess work out of changing the height between grade levels.  I haven't had any problem with any parts dragging on the carpet like some have mentioned.  My back is much happier rolling than lifting.;5;10/17/2011 10:00
260087;My Favorite;"This is my favorite stand for mallet instruments!! It holds  basses in one position and then if you flip the support beam, it can hold altos, alto/tenors, or sopranos. Everything is adjustable. It comes with velcro so that you can stick the instrument on but switch out easily if needed. It doesn't ""clamp"" like some brands do but you can kind of squeeze the bottom part together after putting on the instruments and between that and the velcro, it's super sturdy. The wheels roll smoothly. I wish I had enough for all of my instruments!!";5;4/16/2019 13:41
260087;Not for smaller instruments;"I was purchasing this stand for an alto/tenor xylophone. After I got it together, I realized that it is way too big for the instrument. Additionally this stand does not come with the clamps to hold the instrument in place, it comes with velcro. I am going to switch this one with one of my current  bass stands and hopefully it will work better.

The stand is incredibly sturdy and very well made, the design is just not what I need for soprano and alto instruments in an elementary classroom.";3;1/15/2019 13:46
260087;Sturdy for Bass Xylophones/Metallophones;Not as easy to set up as the table stand, but very sturdy. Personally I prefer the table stand for soprano/alto xylophones. The lowest positioning of the push buttons allows for the same height as the lowest table stand setting. This stand allows for protruding edges, whereas the table stand is flush.;5;7/27/2012 10:00
260087;Awesome for all xylophones/metallophones!;I purchased one of these stands last year for my Global Beat Bass Xylophone, mainly because the global beat instruments aren't overly durably constructed, shall we say, and I figured that if the students were able to move it by rolling it rather than constantly picking it up, it would extend the life of the xylophone.  It works beautifully with the bass, but I was skeptical about how it would work with the sopranos and altos until I bought two more this year.  It works just as well with the smaller instruments, and I do not feel nervous at all about them being top heavy or anything as I feared.  The heights adjust easily so it's no big deal to switch between 6th graders and first graders.  The velcro definitely helps a lot to add to the stability and safety of the instruments on the stands.  I will be buying more of these stands!;5;2/16/2013 10:00
260087;Great Stand for Barred Instruments;These carts are easy to put together and make movement of instruments so much easier.  They are sturdy and I have never had an instrument fall over.  The velcro provided keeps the xylophone securely anchored in place, but can also be removed if need be.  These carts are a quality product.;5;9/2/2011 10:00
260087;GREAT product;I was provided some grant money and decided to get my Orff instruments up off the floor with 20 of these rolling carts.  So far, I have been nothing short of thrilled with them.  I like that the kids can move them around the room as needed - for sound grouping/management/performance.  My taller 5th graders appreciate that the instrument can be raised for them.  The only very minor drawback was the lack of assembly instructions.  It did not take long to figure out, however.;5;5/27/2011 10:00
260087;These carts are great;I have 5 in my classroom and I'm getting two more. They have held up really well for a few years now. They need to be tightened occasionally, but they are great quality! They're adjustable for use with all the orff instruments I have, including the studio 49 flat boxes.;5;8/19/2021 11:42
260959;Great Quality;Great quality, this mallet paired with the drum produces a beautiful tone. Just keep it away from your dog, it looks like a chew toy.;5;9/14/2011 10:00
261015;Quality mallets;The quality of the mallets were great.;5;5/1/2012 10:00
261016;A good option;After having students use these and the Basic Beat (BBRM) 261013, I've definitely come to prefer these in the classroom. They hold up well to wear and tear much better than the Basic Beat competitor- years better.;4;8/26/2019 15:10
261018;Great quality mallets;Easy to order, arrived quickly and they are of expected quality.;5;4/13/2012 10:00
261150;Cool Aluminum;Let's me use a glock to produce the sound for a bell tree.;5;8/28/2012 10:00
261188;Perfect for my needs!;I have some really old instruments that aren't even Sonar, but these pegs made perfect replacements for the ones that were missing.  I like that they are flexible, which will keep them from breaking off again.;5;7/14/2011 10:00
261227;Excellent Purchase;These mallets are very similar to those that originally came with my Sonor Global Beat Alto Xylophone. They sound excellent and make a great addition to our therapy instrument collection. Having a second set of mallets allows multiple students or student/therapist to play together.;5;11/27/2011 10:00
261272;Super Handy;Love this bag. It protects the instrument well and makes it easy to carry around.;5;9/8/2012 10:00
262030;Work Great;"I use these all the time, people ""fight"" over them, as it makes it easy to play your drums. Sturdy and I need more! They don't work for all drums but are great for the Versa and a few of my other drums. Just need to measure the base and compare to the stand.";5;12/16/2012 10:00
262355;Conga Drums by LP City Series;I am so glad that I recently purchased this beautiful set of conga drums for my music classroom.  The drums are high quality instruments with an appealing look.  My students are thrilled with how beautiful the drums sound when we use them in class.  They all want to play! Thank you, West Music!;5;7/21/2012 10:00
262498;Woowy;Great sticks for a great show. They work as they should and take a beating. Literally;5;9/10/2020 20:03
262498;Students love - tedious up keep;My classes absolutely love this product, even my too cool 5th graders! However, 5 classes in and we are experiencing bulbs not lighting up and bulbs not turning off. So far I’ve not had success changing the batteries. The sticks have held up well, and the effects are amazing in a darkened room. Hoping to get some help from an electric guru soon!;3;5/11/2021 22:26
263058;These mallets are fantastic!;These mallets are so well-made.  They feel nice in the hand with the foam handles.  The weight of them is perfect for my 5th graders.  I think they will last for a long time.  My school has a very old bass marimba.  The mallets the students were using for the instrument were not correct.  Now that we have Tom's mallets, it's almost as if we got a new bass!  The sound that is produced using is much better.  You hear more tone, rather than hearing the actual mallet hit the bar.  Thank you.;5;3/18/2012 10:00
263377;Not great thing;The sound is good but I have to say it is very thin, you may notice some dents after you play.;5;6/25/2012 10:00
263846;No complaints;I purchased this for my son, who has been playing tenors for a couple of years. It was packaged really well and arrived on time. He really likes this pad so far.;5;10/21/2012 10:00
264050;Large Mini Market Basket.;This is an amazing product. It was fun to reshape it. It is at the moment in the middle of my dining room table. I love it I liked that my purchase helped the people who make these. I may order another one for a friend. .;5;2/22/2013 10:00
264134;It's fantastic.;It's fantastic. VKB5 has been two weeks old for me. I'm excited about obedience and ease of playing. I recommend to any drummer!;5;5/16/2013 10:00
264868;Must have product;Bought several of these they are worth every penny. Not only for organization but also to travel with!;5;11/12/2019 11:11
300002;Problem with two chord bars;The autoharp arrived from West Music promptly and carefully packaged.   It's beautiful and after 2 tunings sounds pretty good.    Unfortunately,  the G7 and E7 chord bars are not dampening all the strings correctly and I cannot play these chord without lots of dissonance. I was surprised that the Oscar Schmidt materials in the box and the warranty information did not include a number I could call.   I wrote and mailed a letter to them as instructed in the warranty materials and asked if they can send me replacement bars.    Should I expect them to send me the replacement parts or is that something West Music would do?;4;10/12/2012 10:00
300187;Wonderful instrument;My students introduced me to this Dulcimer Kit.  Since then, I have had many students make them.  It has become a favorite activity.  It is simple to put together, easy to learn, and it makes a very pleasant musical sound.  It is a perfect instrument for learning music.  It is ideal for learning how to pick out melodies, add harmony, and learn chords and chord progressions.  It helps students visualize scale patterns and modes.  It is easy to play.;5;7/18/2019 17:13
301548;Can't say enough - Fantastic;"Exceptional guitar for the money !
Exceeded expectations. Perfect 1st guitar for children that isn't a toy or high quality travel guitar for any age. Number one, it's beautiful ! Well crafted with wonderful attention to detail. Very pretty woods with high gloss. Play ability is very good with strings close to fingerboard. Narrow neck width is great for small fingers. The tone and volume is very good also for a 3/4 guitar. It is staying in tune very well so far, very important and sometimes hard to find on a small, relatively inexpensive guitar ! Highly impressed with the quality of this guitar. Could easily be the best available out there at this price point ! Definitely recommend";5;1/9/2020 11:51
301632;fine instrument for the money;I picked mine up from a thrift shop, in like new condition. It came with the bag, noter and pick.  I had it tuned up and playing in no time and it has been a blast. My wife has since swiped it, so I may have to get another!;5;5/27/2012 10:00
301807;Amigo Guitar;"These are a well built and rugged guitar that I have used with my elementary guitar students for eight years. They are light weight and have a pleasant timbre and they stay in tune well.

Excellent value.";5;11/29/2010 10:00
302275;Excellent Starter Guitar!;This guitar sounds amazing for little fingers to begin their musical journey! My daughter loves playing it and the craftsmanship is great! If you're looking for a good sounding beginning guitar for kids, look no further! This guitar is the one you should choose!;5;4/22/2012 10:00
302395;Digitech RP-55;"From what I have heard on the internet, this is a good peice of equipment to add to your electric guitar. Also, I learned about this from a Pedal Steel player. He loves it because He can use this rather then several other pedals, like a reverb and delay pedals. He is on youtube.com. and it sounds great! I am ordering one for my Pedal Steel output!!! Thank you.

302538;1/2 size Yamaha Classical Guitar;This guitar is beautifully made and has a sweet sound...I have loaned it to students to get the idea of chords with a manageable size neck for their hands...and, at the right age, they transition easily to the full size guitar once their hand “gets the idea” of the chord on this guitar. A wonderful way to help students with smaller and/or weaker hands.;5;2/15/2013 10:00
302963;Kala ukelele;I purchased this instrument for my Granddaughter who is studying to become a music therapist at Warburg. She loves it and tuned it immediately and played a tune or two! Very satisfied with whole process! Thank you;5;10/31/2012 10:00
302964;Absolutely amazing instrument;"Having played for about 18 months on this instrument, I am truly impressed with the large sound and depth of it.
I own a Martin Tenor which is the standard of the world, but I expect that quality and integrity.  However, the Kala
baritone is simply amazing- it keeps it tuning and simply sounds great.  I keep looking around to add to my collection, but nothing seems to compare. I am grateful
That I was fortunate to be shipped an instrument that sounds great and plays in tune.  I play classical music only
And look forward to the day I can perform in small venues.
Thank you. My musical history includes many years as a percussionist performing  at the Desert Inn Hotel in Las Vegas and the U.S. Military Academy Band at West Point.
Thank you, Angelo.";5;8/5/2018 9:38
302969;Great for school music class;I began playing ukuleles with my 5th graders this year,  The Makala have a great sound and stay in tune without daily tuning. I plan to order several more to increase the number in my class set.;5;2/24/2019 18:39
303023;Great little Uke;I bought this uke for my 6 year old to start taking lessons.  He absolutely loves it and it sounds pretty good.  The price was right on for a beginner.  Its good enough to not be a toy but an instrument but it wasn't expensive enough for me to freak out every time my son knocks it into something.  Great product, fast shipping.;5;12/24/2012 10:00
303097;This critter is FUN!;"I bought the Yamaha Guitalele because I wanted a ukulele; however, I am not terribly experienced at the guitar and I thought that learning a new instrument right now would slow down my guitar progress. Enter the Guitalele; problem solved! I am able to play my chords and notes I know with the sound I was looking for in a ""fun-size"" guitar. It uses regular classical guitar strings, so finding and changing strings isn't a big deal. For $99, the Guitalele is a great deal for a nifty portable instrument with that happy ukulele sound.";5;5/31/2011 10:00
303325;beautiful and good sound but with defect the nut and the frets;its has been over one year that i bought this vihuela the nut is not straight and kind of high causing a buffing of sound and the frets was out of tune. I am from canada and it is really hard to get vihuelas and guitarron i was hoping that this vihuela come out  good quality..i am late with the review but it is really frustrating not to be able to get a good vihuela without going to mexico;5;4/3/2012 10:00
303678;Great guitar value!;This guitar has been my go-to for classroom accompanying and guitar teaching.  It is a great sounding guitar for the price, well-constructed, and lightweight for carrying around.  I always recommend students in need of purchasing a guitar to check this one out!;5;8/27/2012 10:00
303685;Pleased;I ordered these for a missions trip at my church. They are all in good shape and an excellent value for the money.;5;4/24/2013 10:00
303685;Best Economy Ukulele I have found;I have a classroom set of these I bought from West Music.  They stay in tune better and faster than the Diamond Heads that I also like.  I am not an expert, I believe the Aquila strings are worth buying this ukulele.  They look and sound great.  Highly recommend.;5;1/10/2019 16:52
304421;Ease of playing;This guitar is simply beautiful, fits well, easy to play with a precise tone. The quality of sound is surprisingly full considering the price - so reasonable. I am a Board Certified Music Therapist and wanted a lighter guitar for my clients and students to listen to and play. My old guitar is too expensive, heavy and difficult to play. This new guitar is perfect for travel, has a clean, simple look with ease in fingering and a big sound. I recommend it - if you  are an accomplished guitarist or a beginner.;5;1/12/2012 10:00
305331;Beautiful ukulele;This solid top ukulele is everything I wanted. I was looking for an upgrade after my initial ukulele (a Snail Ukulele). This ukulele is beautiful and sounds incredible. I love that its a different wood from my previous one (this one is ovangkol and my previous was mahogany). I had a concert size, and this one is a tenor, which makes it just a little harder to play. Overall the sound is rich, full and im excited to be able to amp it both for recording purposes and to perform. Really happy with this. Also, West music has superb customer service and have responded to my questions promptly. Plus i got ground shipping but it got here 3 days after I ordered it!;5;8/13/2020 17:12
305335;Great instrument - Great value;I am very pleased with my purchase of the Cordoba 24T.  It would be a value at twice the price.  Looks great, sounds great, and I couldn't be happier with the purchase.;5;8/29/2019 14:21
305657;There is nothing like a LuLu;I too have owned my Lulu ukulele for more than seven years now. In that time I have played dozens of others, many more expensive even. However, nothing has even come close to the sound and playability of my Lulu.;5;7/5/2019 6:58
305657;Beautiful instrument;"Beautiful tones and feel
The abalone accents and beautiful finish makes this stand out. The custom fit basket weave pattern plush hard case finish the package perfectly";5;3/25/2019 21:28
305657;Best Ukulele for the intermediate to advanced player - Hands Down;I've owned a LuLu Tenor and Soprano for about 6 years.  I'm a pro-level player with many VERY expensive Hawian made instruments.  The beauty of the LuLu (initially) was that if I broke it, or it was stolen....It wouldn't have broken my heart.  However, the more I've played them (both), the more I've changed my mindset!  They are terrific instruments and I would never want to part with either of them!;5;9/6/2020 14:19
305657;Amazing instrument;I've had my Lulu for about 7 years now and I have been very pleased with the quality, sound and overall playability ’;5;6/10/2019 4:49
305657;Where did LuLu go;I currently own three LuLu instruments and want to buy another for a girlfriend.  The owner was a sweetheart of a man.  I heard he was sick and was forced to stop making them for a while.  Might anyone know for sure?;5;8/4/2021 15:44
305912;Super Instrument;I received this set with grant money.   They are a nice sounding instruments and seem to be well built.   I've had them for about a month.   I have to tune them daily,  but I've been using them with 3 classes/day so tuning is to be expected.   They are holding their tuning better each time.  Would totally recommend this set.;5;4/1/2013 10:00
306074;Amazing sound and value;I purchased one of these at a music educators conference and have been playing it for a few months now. This thing really does sound wonderful and holds it's pitch well. Definitely sounds more expensive than the $80 price tag. If you haven't had the chance to try baritone uke yet, pick one of these up! You get the beautiful richness of acoustic guitar with the simplicity of the ukulele. West Music  did a great job with this one.;5;6/11/2020 21:55
306227;Sweet voice & Big voice;"It shipped super fast, which is typical with West Music.  The instrument tuned up easily, unlike ukuleles I've ordered from another online retailer named after a river.  The ukulele has a BIG voice when i use the rhythm pick (egg shaker pick) with it and a sweet mellow sound when I strum with my fingers.  It is a DELIGHT to play!

Right now my choir kids are rehearsing outside with a sad battery powered keyboard.  I really miss having them gathered around the piano.  This baritone ukulele might help us find our voices again while we are stuck outside, spread out.  At least I won't feel sad playing it!  It is a gem!";5;9/16/2020 21:22
306373;Really nicely made;This violin is really nice. I had the chance to try it out at a teacher's workshop and I was really surprised and impressed with its quality. I would like to get my classroom either this violin or the Cocula model, which is a little less $$.;5;1/31/2019 14:16
306373;The money is worth it.;"I was surprised at how good the violin sounded. Loved the design of the case and the violin. The case is very strong and durable. Also love the lock that comes with the case
. The top pocket also fits a lot of  items and all the straps seem ever durable.Although i would like a decent shoulder rest and rosin for all the money.

P.S. don't pay for the express shipping I did get my violin the day they said it would arrive but beside the shipping the violin is worth the money if you are deciding on making violin playing a serious effort.";5;12/31/2019 18:50
306516;Kala Spruce on Koa;"Love this uk. I've been playing uk for over 30 years and this one i absolutely love. Great projection nice fingerboard width makes it easy to finger.
The only other one i might consider would be a Kamaka but I live in the desert and need a layered back & sides and Kamaka only has solid back & sides.
My guitars also are layered back & sides.
This is a beautiful uk with a great sounding solid Spruce top that vibrates better as I use it.
And at around 1/4 the price i have a uk thats second to kamaka.
I searched for this exact uk for years.
I've owned this one for around 8 months now and it sounds better as I use it.
Highly recommend.";5;9/12/2020 17:27

350278;Great bag!;Perfect Q-chord gig bag. Makes it easy to transport.;5;9/9/2012 10:00
350625;What a handy little tool!;I am seriously prone to dropping my picks and/or them falling into the guitar. What do I do when that happens during one of my music therapy sessions? This little thing comes in handy at all the right times. There's also a sticky pad behind it to let you attach it to your guitar. I attached it to the heel of my guitar's neck, and that's a great location. 4 stars because it's a little too large for standard size picks, so you might accidentally take out more than one at a time, and it doesn't stick incredibly well to the guitar. I'll probably replace it with a 3M command strip soon.;4;8/5/2011 10:00
350653;The standard;I've been playing guitar for 60 years and whenever I get new picks I always ask the same question: what do you have that's closest to a Fender medium? I do cross picking, strumming, and solos in country , bluegrass and rock. The Fender medium pick is perfect for all styles.;5;9/20/2020 18:16
351924;Okay tuning wrench but does not fit Orthey AH;Ordered this for my lap harp, but it is too big.  Also does not fit Orthey autoharp.  It fits my hammer dulcimer, but I already have two much better wrenches for that. Vendor gave me a refund.  Kudos to West Music for that.;3;9/13/2011 10:00
352053;great size and durable;These are wonderful big pics that are very useful in music therapy. They assist in making it easier for an individual to strum a guitar;5;6/20/2012 10:00

353807;Great Fingerboard Tapes;My young violin students love their new fingerboard tapes.  The tape is a perfect width and the easy to use rolls of tape make installation so much easier.;5;4/11/2012 10:00
354284;Chord Buddy Guiar Learning System;My students instantly caught on and students I was beginning to loose due to frustration Gained bak immediately! I wasn't sure was I was going to think about this system but so far I am a fan and my students really like it and have stuck with guitar because of it!;5;4/12/2012 10:00
354737;Great;"I have used this bow grip for years. It's just great for me and... Students who have issues with bowing!
This device will correct most of the problems.
Use it! It works!";5;7/5/2020 10:57
354768;Kala UB-C Concert Ukulele Gig Bag;At under $20, this is a fabulous value!  Lightweight, but thick enough to feel protective.  If your hands are full, it has backpack straps.;4;6/6/2012 10:00
354769;Uke bag;Very nice product! Fit instrument perfectly.;5;11/26/2012 10:00
354868;Additional padding needed;"Of good construction, typical of Gator, a very suitable and serviceable bag. It did not however provide the snug fit to my tenor that I had hoped. Not a problem as long as I wrap the instrument before packing. The gig bag was just a bit ""baggy!""";3;9/16/2011 10:00
354927;Ukulele  stand;This stand seems like it will be sturdy and last for a long time.  Easy to adjust and fits any of my ukulele sizes with a simple adjustment.;5;12/16/2011 10:00
354985;Excellent tuner;This tuner works really well on ukuleles and guitars. It looks awesome and has a great price. The best feature about this tuner is that it shuts off by itself after a few minutes and save your battery.;5;12/13/2012 10:00
355036;Doesn't work with Kala ukes;So upset and disappointed!  Ordered a set for my music classes to find that these Kala straps do not fit the Kala Waterman ukes!  You'd think that since they are made by the same company they would be compatible!  The clip does not fit into the sound hole without hitting against the strings, and the clip does not go around the sound hole due to the inner lip in the uke design.;1;1/7/2020 8:22
355038;Ukulele on the go;This strap was easy to adjust and fit right on to my ukulele with no problem.  Now when I walk around my class room directing a game I don't have to hold my ukulele so tightly.  Strap helps a lot.;4;12/18/2011 10:00
355040;Kala Soriano ukekele bag;Nice, sturdy bag. Instrument fits well! Nice handle for carrying and straps;5;4/18/2013 10:00
355051;This product was great….the service was even better!;"It's about saying ""Thank You!"" for great products, great prices, and great service over the years.  You are the instant ""Go To"" company whenever I need ANYTHING for my school music program!  Thank you very much for helping us to be successful in our educational mission.";5;12/12/2011 10:00
355474;Great Strings for Great Price;The only strings I will use on my violin. Love the price. They stay in tune. They last for a long time & they sound great.;5;3/10/2012 10:00
355474;"Beginner's Best Friend; far better than stock strings!";I really like these strings because they are well made and they're cheap. The E has lasted through much abuse and shows no sign of breaking anytime soon. It reminds me of my Westminster E. I think the sound produced is better as well. I don't really have anything bad to say about these strings, they have a great sound and are good enough for an amateur to use on stage. Beginners as well as the intermediate violin musician should like these strings for the sound and the play-ability of these strings. These strings also hold the tuning very well.;5;1/31/2012 10:00
356171;Great for a mix of instruments;I'm using this to hold four guitars of various sizes, a ukulele and a mandolin, and everything fits very nicely. I was able to set the top bar so that both the larger and smaller instruments can rest in the rack sideways. Whoever wrote the instructions doesn't seem to have talked to whoever packaged the parts, but if you stare at everything for a couple of minutes you'll figure it out, and assembly and adjustment are physically very easy. This is a major upgrade from keeping a pile of cases in a corner.;5;9/12/2020 12:56
356171;Tight fit but excellent quality;Assembling is a challenge - unclear instructions.  The 12 ukes fit, but you must be super precise and careful putting them in and taking them out. For 11 or less, that would not be a problem.  Excellent quality.;4;8/22/2019 10:18
356171;Perfect once set up;Great product! However, instructions are poor. Photos do not show details of set up.;5;3/5/2019 19:02
356369;This was a gift. Lucky for me I have engineering skills!;This item requires set-up. It would be helpful if legs, base and upright parts were marked somehow: right-left, in-out, front-back, etc. I put the first leg on backwards and on wrong side before I figured it out! Kind of a pain when doing it single-handedly and parts must be screwed together (OK I have two hands, just no assistant)! Simple stickers with  letters, numbers or colors to match-up with the directions would be helpful. Otherwise, it is a solid, well made rack (I got the natural wood color). The perfect size for the space we have at home. It holds four guitars in hard cases (one hard case is a large Hoffee, one is for an old dobro) plus one padded gig bag that holds a Dobrato (Google it! Made by Castle Creek Guitars in Gunnison, Colorado). So far I have not had any complaints from my husband (the owner -player of all those guitars). He is considering another for our studio.;4;1/25/2013 10:00
356705;Favorite tuner;I have 6 of these little gems. I use them on both ukuleles and guitars. My only gripe is that they don’t work with slot headed ukes or guitars. Next version maybe? Love these tuners. I’ll be buying more.;5;9/11/2019 0:38
400183;Sturdy;I ordered the kazoos for my piano recital and am very impressed with how well made they are! They are going to last a lot longer than others I've tried.  The students are getting great sound out of them and love the colors. For all the joy they give the students, the price is good, so if I need kazoos again, West will be the place I choose to order from.;5;3/29/2012 10:00
400183;kazoo heaven;these kazoos are reliable.  the kids love the colors and I love that they hold up for all they use they get! Glad they are still available. been ordering them for 10+ years.;5;5/26/2012 10:00
400183;Great buy!;I ordered these for my 2nd/3rd graders to use on our Spring Concert.  They have a huge sound and are a very good quality.  I compared it with a Hohner I already had and these are much louder.  Worked out very well and when I need them again I will definitely go with these!;5;6/13/2012 10:00
400183;Great quality kazoos!;The preschool age kids in my music classes love these! Much better than the party favor types of these.;5;6/18/2012 10:00
400183;West Music Kazoos;Excellent quality, thick plastic, bright colors.  My kids love these!  In a pack of 100, I have yet to find one that is not the quality that I expected.  Thanks!;5;3/29/2013 10:00
400183;Great quality kazoos;These are being used in a 3rd grade concert and the kids are having a blast for them (though I think that 90 kids playing at once may be a bit much!). Only had one that wouldn't work. They are very durable and I think will last a long time. Love that they are made in the U.S.!;5;4/8/2013 10:00
400183;Great kazoo, great price;I was searching for kazoos to use in my 2nd grade class as we prepare for a special song during our annual Christmas program. The students were so excited at the prospect of kazoos that I did not want to end up with kazoos with a poor sound, or ones that would break easily. These kazoos are wonderful! Affordable, durable, brightly colored. They have a wonderful sound (as far as kazoos go) and the students love them.;5;11/22/2011 10:00
400183;Best Kazoo!;These are sturdy kazoos with a reliable sound.  Not a single one has been a dud! My 3rd-6th grade choir is using them, and they love them!  For health concerns, we make sure each kazoo is labeled with the student's name, and stored in its own zipper baggie.;5;9/24/2011 10:00
400183;Great Kazoo Quality;We ordered kazoos for our boychoir beginning group for a song they are doing. These kazoos are high quality and have withstood the typical rigors that 8-9 year old boys would put them through.;5;5/18/2012 10:00
400183;Kazoos Sound Great!;I have previously purchased kazoos from other companies, and yours is the very best ones that I have found. They have a great sound (for a kazoo!) and are easy for kids to play.;5;5/6/2012 10:00
400215;Solid recorder;I've loved Angel recorders for years and am so glad to be able to buy a class set! I love the unibody construction and it produces has a pleasing tone with ease.;5;1/8/2012 10:00
400215;Great Recorder!!;Purchased this recorder for my 4th grade daughter who needed it for music class. We actually ordered 2 so she could keep 1 at school, and 1 at home to practice.  The recorder is perfect for any elementary student just learning to play!!;5;4/2/2012 10:00
400215;Excellent Value;I order about 200-300 of these babies every year, for the past 5 years, and I have had no problem using and teaching them to my students, grade 3-6. Excellent tone quality, and overall very well made. Plus, when you order over 100, shipping and handling are free. I have the students buy 2 recorders each, one for use in school and one for practice at home. I would not use or consider any other brand of recorder nor would I order from anywhere else except West Music as they offer the lowest price I've seen for this brand and model of soprano recorder. Thanks West Music!;5;10/3/2011 10:00
400215;Summer Camp Music Class;Great for students, grades 2nd - 7th;5;8/5/2012 10:00
400215;Love this;love this recorder. the finger chart is super helpful for my new players;5;8/13/2012 10:00
400215;Perfect for our students!;This one-piece Baroque-fingering recorder is exactly what our music teacher needs - no sections to distract the students and require tuning.  And, the price is right!;5;12/25/2012 10:00
400220;Other modifications;"I have used this excellent product, but wish to mention a couple of additional fixes that might help, and are within the ability of most music teachers.  1) I had a student with one arm who had trouble holding the instrument while playing, so I cut and sanded a brace from 3/8"" plywood that he could hold between his knees, and screwed the narrow top end of the brace to the lower underside of the recorder.   2) Another student had one normal arm and hand, but only two small fingers on the other very short arm.  I made a mitered cut between the 3rd and 4th finger holes, and reglued the instrument at a right angle, so the lower section pointed back toward the right side of her mid chest, allowing her arm and fingers to reach two additional holes.  I used the special super glue for plastics for this.";5;2/9/2020 18:24
400220;Special Needs Recorder;I am very excited to try this recorder.  It looks like a perfect solution for my student that does not have the use of all of her fingers!;5;10/26/2011 10:00
400220;Great product for hand dexterity issues;Really appreciate WestMusic supplying an excellent affordable product for those with hand dexterity issues.  My 9 year old son has limited use of his left hand but wanted to be able to play a recorder like his classmates.  It is still challenging but this instrument makes it possible for him to play.;5;7/9/2012 10:00
400220;A204AF 7-piece C soprano recorder;There is nothing wrong, per se, with this instrument, but I was disappointed to discover after receiving it that it is German fingering.  I wish there had been a choice for English fingering (or maybe there was and I just didn't see it).;5;11/18/2011 10:00
400220;Grateful;Although I've had only one class with my student using this instrument, I can already see a difference in his ability and interest in playing.  It's not a magic wand, but it gives this particular student no excuses!  And I like that.;5;9/26/2012 10:00
400222;lovely instrument;I bought this tenor recorder for the closer holes. It's still easier to play an alto, but maybe I was hoping for too much. In any event that's why I gave it 4 stars & not 5. I really want to give it 4.5, but that's not an option. The recorder also has a beautiful tone, & plays easily. I would certainly recommend it to anyone who wants to play tenor, but is bothered by the distance between the tone holes. I think someone with really small hands would still have a problem with this instrument, though.;5;4/10/2012 10:00
400222;My fingers can reach the holes;"Just got this new Aulos tenor recorder.  I have been playing the alto.  I bought this one because it said it would work for people with small hands.  It is a bit of a stretch, but I can play it. My index finger is 2 3/4"" long and my middle finger is 3"" long. I figured it was not too expensive to buy one and try it out.  Now I just have to learn the new fingering.....";5;6/7/2012 10:00
400224;new to me;This size of recorder is new to me, but I am enjoying practicing. This brand seems to be quality even though I could have purchased a more expensive brand and a less expensive brand. I think it will suffice for my purpose which is is to demonstrate for students in 3-5th grades.;5;8/20/2011 10:00
400278;Perfect gift!;My 9 year old bought this recorder for my 19 year old so they could practice together from a thousand miles away. A fun gift that keeps the girls bonded while the oldest is away at college.;5;11/4/2012 10:00
400278;Great quality for great value!;I'm always pleased with my purchase of these recorders!;5;7/2/2012 10:00
400278;Great Item!;These recorders are perfect for my 4th and 5th grade students.  Very reasonable price and good quality. They also came in a very timely manner, which made the kiddos excited!!;5;12/11/2012 10:00
400278;Harmony 3-Piece WM2400 Soprano Recorder;This recorder is excellent: it's tuned correctly, durable, the quality is outstanding & is the price especially for the entire package...canvas cotton breathable case, plastic cleaning rod, & fingering chart. The students sound great!! Kudos;5;1/4/2019 9:56
400278;Harmony 3-Piece Recorder;Great product at a reasonable price!;5;11/13/2012 10:00
400278;Good Quality Recorders;"I was a fortunate South Texas teachers who received the TMEA grant and we decided to purchase these recorders for our students.  I love the quality of these instruments.  In the past we used the color recorders and every time I needed to sanitize them I would have a lot of water left in the mouth piece.
The tone is a lot like a top brand instrument and a must have for anyone looking to save a few more bucks for their students.";5;9/6/2018 10:32
400278;Elementary School Recorder Order;Overall, I was really happy with the product. I was looking for something that had multiple pieces for practicing purposes. However, I was hoping the sound quality would be a little better.;5;4/30/2012 10:00
400278;Great service!;We have always been very satisfied with the service from West Music.  They have quick response to any questions and their delivery is always very quick.  Thank you !;5;11/15/2012 10:00
400278;Perfect for General Music;I love these recorders for my general music kids.  The cost is reasonable for all students, and they stand up for multiple years of use (I've seen some used by four kids in the same family!).  The bags might not be the best, but a ziplock bag works just as well.  The instruments are durable and appreciated!;5;11/2/2012 10:00
400278;Good Classroom Recorder;We used this recorder in fourth grade classroom music. It is a good starting recorder for the students. It does tend to squeak a little more than the Yamaha's I used previously, but not enough for me to stop using them. I like that they are three parts, come with a cleaning rod, and include a fingering chart. The canvas bags they come in do not hold up well, so make sure you tell the students to be extra careful with them if you want to use them all year or longer.;5;6/21/2012 10:00
400278;Good quality for the price;I teach recorders to my 4th grade classroom.  The students will buy the recorders from me and the price is reasonable enough that they all will buy one.;5;2/3/2012 10:00
400278;Great Purchase;Ordering was simple, delivery was quick, and I got exactly what I ordered. The sound quality is just fine for an elementary classroom.;5;2/4/2013 10:00
400278;Soprano recorders;These recorders look and sound great for my 3rd grade class! Great price, too!;5;4/20/2013 10:00
400278;Perfect Harmony!;We bought 50 of these recorders to use at our children's music camp, and they were perfect.  Didn't have to worry about the kids wanting one color or the other, they were all the same.  The kids put their names on them and went to playing.  They were not hard to play and  they all came out without an injured recorder.  Fast shipping, easy to deal with, will buy again.;5;7/30/2012 10:00
400278;Awesome Recorder!!;I LOVE these recorders!  They are very durable and at a price that can't be beat!  Most of my school students are on free/reduced lunch and these recorders are easy for them to purchase! Thank you West Music for helping my students be able to buy their own instruments!  They are so proud!;5;3/22/2013 10:00
400278;Very Reliable;Customer service was excellent. Shipping was very fast. Excellent product for the purchase price.;5;5/9/2012 10:00
400278;Always Reliable!;These recorders are such a great buy for the classroom. They're inexpensive enough that even in my low-income school, most of the students are able to purchase their own. They are sturdy enough to withstand backpacks and drops. Great purchase as always!;5;10/4/2011 10:00
400278;Great quality for the price;I am at a Title 1 school in an urban school district.  The quality sound of a more expensive recorder is not as achievable on this little recorder but for the price, it is well worth it.  I have another brand recorder that a previous music teacher had purchased and the children that use those seem to have an easier time achieving a good sound.  With that being said, those recorders are $9-$10 each versus the $3 of the Harmony recorder including a canvas bag and cleaning rod.  I am happy with the purchase for our needs.;5;12/6/2012 10:00
400282;Yamaha 300 alto recorder;This instrument has a wonder tome, even in the lower register. I can't wait to use it in class!;5;1/12/2013 10:00
400286;Sleek;The wood felt a bit soft, but the tone was spot on for my band.;4;8/1/2018 21:50
400288;Great Product;We purchase these recorders for our students to use for music class.  They are great and easy to use.  They are also very durable.  Our order arrived with a week.  Great product and service.;5;10/7/2011 10:00
400288;Great recorders!;My students love these recorders and they are easy for them to play the low notes on!  I have been ordering them for years!;5;2/9/2012 10:00
400288;Online purchase of Recorder;Very quick delivery! Great for beginner.;5;2/29/2012 10:00
400288;Yamaha recorder;Awesome recorder and the price was very decent! My son loves it.;5;3/25/2013 10:00
400288;great school recorder;I ordered this model of recorder in the 3 available colors for my elementary school. The recorders are attractive, play well, and are durable. My only complaint is that the cases are not very strong and tear easily and the recorders don't come with a cleaning rod.;5;7/23/2012 10:00
400288;Yamaha recorders;The only thing I did not love is the case, if you keep the fingering chart in the case, it is hard for younger students to place the recorder in it, they just jam up the paper, trying to force it in.;5;11/11/2011 10:00
400288;Great!;I have ordered these recorders from West Music twice this year and each time, the recorders have come in less than two days.  Fantastic customer service!  My students are very happy :-);5;10/15/2011 10:00
400289;Lime recorder;The kids were very excited to get their new recorders in beautiful colors!;5;2/25/2012 10:00
400291;Excellent price, quality instrument, speedy shipping;This recorder is great for our beginner musicians. Great price with fast shipping, I recommend West Music, and will buy from them again.;5;1/28/2013 10:00
400291;Great recorders!;These are great recorders with a good sound!  I've ordered them for years!Easy for students to play low notes!;5;2/7/2012 10:00
400291;Pink recorders;Received in great condition!!;5;2/24/2012 10:00
400294;Great recorder;Great recorder, however I wish it came with cleaning rods. I did not realize that until I received them.;4;1/18/2013 10:00
400295;Better than we expected;This recorder is absolutely awesome! The bag that came with the recorder is a nice addition as well. It has a great sound and my son is enjoying it very much!;5;3/31/2013 10:00
400295;Yamaha YRS-24B Sop. Recorder;This recorder is a winner!  It has wonderful tone, the price is very reasonable and it sounds good with Orff instruments.  I highly recommend this soprano recorder.;5;9/4/2011 10:00
400295;Great recorder (bag not as great);I love these recorders.  They are durable, in tune, and adjustable for kids with different length fingers.  I have used these for years and enjoyed them.  Going to conventions, sometimes I am given other brands of recorders as a promotion, but they never compare to the Yamaha recorders.  The one thing that sometimes happens is that the casing around the drawstring of the bag gets frayed, as kids put the recorder in and out of the bag.  The bag definitely isn't as durable as the instrument, but I still like the recorders enough to put up with the bag.;5;2/14/2012 10:00
400295;an inexpensive alternative;"Good start, inexpensive, tone a bit ""thin"" but expected for the plastic construction. Like the 3 piece, note no cleaning rod was included, so provide for this. If you can wait to save your pennies for a wooden instrument you may want to consider that,.";5;6/27/2012 10:00
400295;good price and quick delivery;These are just what we needed for our program.  We were happy with the price and they came quickly. Thank you;5;2/1/2013 10:00
400295;Great product;"This is my 31st year as a music educator and I have always been happy with this recorder.  It has a nice tone and is very sturdy.  I have been given other brands and they do not compare.  The only problem that I have had is with students popping out the center of the mouthpiece and then getting it back in crooked.

I do wish that West would throw in a cleaner with this recorder.  The bags are not great but sufficient.";5;9/19/2019 9:03
400295;Excellent beginning recorder;Worth their price- they are in tune, they're easy to play, and they're easy to clean. My only complaint is that the strings on the bags they come in break very easily, making it easy for the recorder to slip out.;5;11/14/2012 10:00
400295;Great quality recorder - reasonable price;I am a general music teacher and when I started at a new school last year, the recorders I inherited were mismatched, aged, of poor quality, and in a dreadful state of cleanliness.  I needed a solution so that my fourth graders would embrace learning the recorder!  I was able to purchase a grade level set of recorders,120 of them, with free shipping and at a reasonable price.  The nice thing about having matched recorders is that one aspect of intonation is solved merely by having identical recorders.  Having a three-piece recorder was an easy choice and was never a problem as I didn't have any issues with kids taking them apart. The Yamaha brand is endorsed by the vast majority of respected educators in our field and this model is particularly good.  Also, if you are using the Recorder Karate program, the end of the recorder and the color allows for a nice display without getting in the way of the quality of the instrument.  Looking for a quality recorder?    Look no further...;5;1/27/2013 10:00
400295;Good purchase with good service;I bought it online on 12/19 wishing for the delivery by Xmas holidays. Then the delivery came to my home on 12/23 with proper packaging. No worry at all with the purchase with the West Music. Good purchase good service to customers.<br /><br />Thanks again,;5;9/18/2011 10:00

400295;Excellent quality student recorders;I bought these recorders for 6th grade students, and they have the look, feel, and sound of true instruments, inspiring my students to treat them as such and to seek to play them accordingly.;5;5/10/2012 10:00
400295;Great Recorder, Flimsy Case;I love these recorders for students! They have a nice sound and they come apart, which allows for adjustments of the bottom hole for small student fingers. The cases they come with, however, are a different story. The drawstring at the top hardly closes and very often comes untied or comes off completely. It is quite annoying.;5;11/25/2012 10:00
400297;Excellent Recorder;Great quality and great sound!;5;9/11/2011 10:00
400297;Great recorder;Skeptical at first, but it does sound a bit better than the other Yamaha he had. West music delivery was fast, arrived in great condition, no calls so no hitches, Thanks Westmusic.;5;8/8/2012 10:00
400298;Pleasant Surprise!;I’m a new teacher, and I learned about elementary music and instruments when I was in college. So each product I get my hands on is a new experience for me. Well, my mentor teacher had this recorder, and I decided I’d get one to distinguish mine from my students who have the ivory ones...and it’s fantastic!! I waited for Christmas money since it’s “so much for a recorder,” but I was really shocked at how pleasant the sound is and it is worth the extra money! Of course, maybe it only makes a difference to those of us with a trained ear, but it is worth it!;5;3/6/2013 10:00
400298;Great Intonation!;I was really hoping it would carry good intonation and this pretty little thing did not disappoint!  And it's very attractive.;5;9/4/2012 10:00
400299;yamaha tenor recorder;Great student instrument.  Sturdy construction with a nice sound.  Easily playable by my elementary students.  This was a great purchase!;5;10/23/2012 10:00
400299;A Great Instrument!;This is my first tenor, so I really have nothing to compare it to. I am enjoying it immensely! Regular, daily practice, and my hands are adjusting (stretching) quite nicely. And I have particularly tiny hands. Instrument comes in the standard Yamaha canvas case, with a swab-stick, joint creme, and a thumb rest that you can stick on as needed.;5;9/7/2012 10:00
400299;Follow-up on my previous review on Yamaha Tenor Recorder.;Now that I have had my Tenor Recorder for @2 months, I want everyone know just how much I am enjoying it.  At first glance, I was afraid that my relatively small fingers would never be able to stretch so far in order to close the finger holes.  I finally got the G note on the left hand, and am now puzzling a similar problem on getting down to D on the right hand- but I will make it.  BTW I am 61, and have rheumatoid arthritis, particularly in my fingers, and many times can only practice every other day- but that has been OK.  The neck-strap really helped to ease the burden on my hands.  I didn't even realize how heavy my recorder was, until I used it.  And the 2 thumb rests I bought (one to lose, one to use) were essential, because the dinky little thumb rest that came with the recorder was soon lost.;5;10/16/2011 10:00
400464;Reasonably-priced whistle;I ordered small percussion for choral song that calls for loud noise makers in several places.;5;12/7/2011 10:00
400484;Fantastic Little Tweeter;Sounds so realistic and was easy to get the hang of! Purchased for my dad and he is so pleased.  Me too! Thanks.;5;2/24/2013 10:00
400556;Fabulous product!;I ordered a dozen of these as party favors for my son's 4th birthday party.  Great quality, nice sound, cute colors, and you can't beat the price!;5;9/9/2011 10:00
400556;So fun!;Purchased 40 of these for an elementary school event and they were a huge hit!;5;11/19/2011 10:00
400556;For my classroom;Tried to tie reading echo and learning to play harmonica with my 6th graders. They actually play all the notes and I could afford them for my self contained class. I had three out of thirty that didn't play all the notes. So I always order 3 extra. Would have given a five if they all worked. Good price for learning to play.;4;4/13/2019 16:30
400556;Great sound quality and construction. Superb value!;I bought four of these for my 2 year old grand-daughter, who picked up playing harmonica from me. We don't let her play with them without adult supervision. I didn't want her using my nice harp, so I searched for these. Other places had the exact same item for a LOT more, so I'm glad these were available from WESTmusic. After I ordered them, I asked for, and received, all four different colors. They are very brightly colored (almost transparent), very sturdy, they sound great, and she loves them so much! A GREAT value! After she loses, breaks, lends out, leaves behind, and whatever else it is little kids do with things, I will be buying more of these, that's for sure.;5;8/17/2011 10:00
400556;Harmonica Choir;As Christmas gifts, for all the grandkids. We are hopeful, there will be music,( however random)this year instead of gun fights.;5;3/3/2013 10:00
400607;Great Alto Recorder;You can't beat the Yamaha 20 series recorders.  The alto and the soprano are terrific and are a great buy for individuals as well as the classroom.  All Yamaha recorders sound great with Orff instruments as well as with any other instrument.  I love Yamaha recorders!;5;9/3/2011 10:00
400624;Amazing;Amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing;5;1/2/2019 17:42
400624;Great recorders;My students love these recorders and I think they sound pretty good too!;5;4/9/2012 10:00
400625;Great addition;This instrument uses Baroque fingering and is a great addition to my classes who use a soprano recorder in 5th-8th grade.  I like the lower sounds it adds so we can perform as an ensemble.;5;7/27/2011 10:00
400627;very good quality reasonably priced instrument;nice sound quality in the low register;5;9/14/2012 10:00
400630;Great Product/Reasonable Price;My students love these recorders.  Great product for a reasonable price.;5;2/11/2012 10:00
400817;Not just for noise!;"These make awesome builders for letters, shapes and even artistic shapes for Preschoolers!  I also had a 9 year old playing with them.  He had fun just making them into a twisty shape that looked like one of those fireworks ""snakes"" we used to have as youngsters.  They are somewhat hard to put together so I can see why the 5 year old and above recommendation, but if you work together with your Preschooler he will love them and have fun learning.";5;11/7/2011 10:00
400817;Voice checks!;"These collapsible tubes are a great distraction for voice assessments. I teach the children a ""melodic pattern"" game to play with a partner. The leader moves one end like a microphone for echo singing, while the other child holds near their ear. I get to play, too! While the children are playing, I'm conducting formative assessments and providing interventions for those children that aren't matching pitch.";5;3/20/2013 10:00
400817;Easily Breakable;The preschool children love to play with the slinky pop tubes.  But they have a very short life span.  They break in pieces and can even prove to be choke hazards.  I throw them away as soon as they crack and separate in pieces.;3;9/14/2011 10:00
400817;Pop toobs (sound tubes) are terrific;These are terrific, for sound exploration and discovering the physics of long=lower, short=higher, and for creative exploration, connecting them and making them into hats, belts, jump ropes....A person working with women recovering from abuse wanted to get some to help her clients express frustration. And--bottom line--they are really fun!;5;9/16/2011 10:00
400817;quick at excellent price;I buy Pop Toobs regularly from West Music. It is a well-designed product. When bought in quantities of 24 or more the price is the best that I have been able to find anywhere. Delivery is always prompt. All kids like these. I buy them for my son with developmental delays because he loves to play with them, especially loves the texture and sound of rubbing the ridges.;5;9/26/2011 10:00
400817;Awesome sound tubes!;My preschool music children love these. My only issue with these is that the tube doesn't fold back in some places correctly after repeated use. They're still pretty durable. It's cool how they connect too!;5;6/17/2012 10:00
400817;Easily Breakable;The preschool children love to play with the slinky pop tubes.  But they have a very short life span.  They break in pieces and can even prove to be choke hazards.  I throw them away as soon as they crack and separate in pieces.;5;6/4/2012 10:00

400837;Blue recorder;The kids were very excited to get their new recorders in beautiful colors!;4;2/26/2012 10:00
400837;Harmony Recorders;"I used these this past year for my 3rd grade music class. I bought them because they were easy on our budget. I was really impressed with the sturdy case, but the instrument itself breaks pretty easily. In our first semester, I had about 20 kids bring me a recorder that was in pieces. Tone wise they can be a little ""breathy,"" as condensation builds up in the mouthpiece after just a few minutes of playing.";4;10/6/2011 10:00
400838;Great recorder for the price;I have used these recorders for several years.  Students love receiving the great colors.  The instrument sounds decent and the case is great for protection.  Great for an affordable price!;4;8/12/2019 13:05
400839;AMAZING;This was amazing and it sounded like angles so smooth I really recommend this😍😍😍!!!!!!!!!!!;5;11/4/2018 9:55
400839;Recorders break easily;I purchased about 200 of these Harmony recorders in various colors for my students 3 years ago. I liked that there were so many color options and that a zippered case and cleaning rod were included, but I had about 20 recorders that needed to be replaced because the top joint would crack and break, the center of the mouthpiece in the whistle blocks were constantly giving students trouble by falling out. I was very disappointed in the product overall. I was told that they were comparable to the Yamaha Translucent recorders before I ordered them and I did not find that to be true. Students also had much more difficulty getting a good sound without squeaks using the Harmony recorders. I have been ordering Yamaha and Angel recorders for my students since then and rarely have the same problems I did with the Harmony brand.;2;1/7/2020 10:31
400839;Harmony Traditional Style Green Translucent 2-Piece Soprano Recorder;My son accidentally broke his recorder that he just received from his music teacher. I placed the order and within a few days and it was well packaged. Thank you West Music! Now my son is a happy camper again.;5;3/11/2012 10:00

400988;Perfect;I played as a kid and decided to start again,  book is easy to follow recorder sounds perfect;5;7/21/2020 0:28
401172;Great recorder for my students;I really like these recorders, especially because they are one piece recorders. I've tried 3 piece recorders in the past but they would not stay together once they came apart (joints would not be tight). Pitch is pretty good but remember there are plastic recorders and they are good for teaching the students fingering and blowing techniques.  One question...why include a cleaning rod? Every time we tried it in the past the cloth got stuck inside and since the recorder doesn't come apart it was nearly impossible to remove the cloth and rod.;5;3/15/2013 10:00
401172;H100 1-Piece Soprano Recorder;Great product at a very reasonable price. Definitely would order again.;5;10/18/2012 10:00
401172;Great Purchase;Fast delivery and good value for the money.;5;8/14/2012 10:00
401172;Great buy!;This is the second year I have purchased these recorders for my general music classes. They sound good, are durable, and you can't beat the price. I like that they are in one piece so I don't have to deal with the kids taking them apart in class. I recycle the fingering chart that comes with it and use the simpler one in the Recorder Karate book. The cleaning rods are too big, so I use them for mini-drumsticks instead. I have the kids blow air through the thumb hole to remove moisture build-up while they are playing, and the recorders can be washed, so the rod isn't really necessary in my opinion. Overall, I am very pleased with this product.;5;5/30/2013 10:00
401172;Pleased;Very pleased with the quality of these recorders. Better than I expected. They look like they cost much more than their cost. I ordered 10 as Christmas Presents for grand-children and they were a big hit.;5;2/14/2013 10:00
401172;Harmony Recorders;Perfect for my 3rd and 4th grade music students. I also buy the neck straps.;5;9/24/2012 10:00
401172;Perfect Recorder for Beginning Musicians;This recorder is high quality with excellent tone. Our fourth graders have used these for the last  two years. You can't beat the quality for the price!;5;8/9/2011 10:00
401172;The Are Very Good Quality Recorders for Elementary School Classes;I am writing a review of the Harmony H100 1-piece recorder with Standard Fingering.  I have been an Elementary School Music Teacher for 11 years.  These recorders are of the same quality as their more expensive models.  I dropped one on the day they came to me and it did not chip or break.  The tone is acceptable for the price as well.  I intend to buy more next year.  You can't have mine.......;5;1/7/2012 10:00
401172;Quality for fewer $;With solid construction, these recorders are perfect for my elementary school students.  The one-piece design makes them simple, and the creamy color makes it easy for me (the teacher) to spot any fingering issues from afar.  The price is terrific, since many students raise money to purchase their own recorders for home use too.  Personal recorders and their accompanying bags are labeled with a felt pen, which is easy to read and identify.;5;3/13/2012 10:00
401172;very pleased;I bought a recorder for my 10 yr. old daughter to practice at home from what she was learning at school.  The ordering process was easy, the price reasonable and the quality of the recorder is excellent!!;5;4/15/2012 10:00
401172;Cost Effective;Good quality for the cost.  Durable and plays well in tune.  Kids will have a blast!;5;4/1/2012 10:00
401172;Harmony H100 Recorder;This recorder is great!!  I have tried others but this one really is easy to play especially the low D and C notes.  Beautiful tone quality.  This recorder is the one to have beginning students purchase.  The price is really affordable for this product.;5;10/7/2012 10:00
401172;recorders;The order came quickly and the Recorders look and sound great,. I even had a problem and it was handled quickly. thanks for the great service.;5;3/19/2013 10:00
401172;For my Son's music class;This product is perfect for beginners. My son loves his new recorder.;5;5/26/2013 10:00
401182;Too much fun;Every music teacher needs one of these. I can't play it without laughing. Such a fun sound!;5;1/27/2012 10:00
401182;Fun for kids!;My students absolutely love using these slide whistles. It's great for teaching about melodic direction. Fun times!;5;9/12/2011 10:00
401183;Fun!;needed a bit more sanding at the mouth hole, but for $5.95, it's a bargain!;5;2/28/2013 10:00
401578;ECODEAR is a great recorder!;I purchased the ECODEAR soprano recorder to use in the recorder consort that I play in, and it not only blends with the others, but soars above with a clear tone when I have the melody. Tuning is much easier than with other recorders I have played, and it is also better in tune with itself. I highly recommend the ECODEAR line.;5;1/30/2013 10:00
401578;Very responsive;This is a nice recorder!  Great intonation - if anything a little on the bright side, which I like.  Upper and lower registers both very close to pitch.  It also played easily in the upper register.;5;1/14/2012 10:00
401578;This is my new FAVORITE recorder;the YRA-402B is worth every penny.  The tone is mellow and it's much easier to play in the upper octave than most other plastic recorders.  It seems to weigh a little more (I may be wrong about that) so it feels more substantial.  This summer I decided to purchase several different plastic soprano recorders in the $20-$40 range so I could compare models over a period of time (more so than just trying them out at a store).  The 400 series Yamaha recorders came out on top.  It's still too expensive for my beginner 4th and 5th graders to buy, but I'm planning to purchase 10 this year for my Recorder Consort kids to play.;5;11/10/2011 10:00
401578;The Yamaha YRS-402B Soprano Recorder is absolutely Awesome.;"My experience with the Yamaha ECODEAR YRS-402B is absolutely awesome.  The look is fabulous.  The weight is ideal.  It might be a little heavier than its wooden kind.  However, the recorder's exact weight makes it seem more worthy and well crafted (which it is).  The hold and feel of it is wonderful.  It really feels like a professional instrument.  The sound is clear and well spoken.  If I was blindfolded, I'd choose this recorder as a most appropriate musical instrument of performance.  I give it a Five Star rating.

Thank you West Music, and Yamaha.

401578;Nice little recorder;I am enjoying my new YRS-402B Baroque soprano recorder very much.  I like the butterscotch color.  It was a little bit sharp but pulling a bit put it in tune with the other sopranos in my recorder groups.  It was recommended to me by another recorder player, who said the tone was superior to the Yamaha-300 series we already had.;5;12/31/2011 10:00
401578;The best plastic recorder I've used.;I am a class teacher and bought this recorder to see if I would like to order them for my class.  I already own the Yamaha 312B Soprano recorder and my kids have an Aulos, and a different Yamaha.  I also have an inexpensive wooden Moeck recorder.  This new plant-based plastic Yamaha has the best sound of all of them.  It is heavier and denser than the 312 and has a smooth, even tone that is indistinguishable from the wooden recorder.  It is about $10 cheaper than the 312 too.  For my class of third graders, the plastic will be much easier to take care of over the next few years.;5;12/11/2011 10:00
401584;wonderful recorder;I have been looking for a soprano recorder that is affordable, yet responsive in all registers.  This is it. High A-C pop out like a dream. Superb intonation and sweet tone. The curved wind way puts it a cut above everything else in this price range.;5;3/25/2019 11:19
401623;Almost perfect;Sounds good, excellent shape...only thing missing is the keyhole configuration...;4;5/29/2021 12:59
401623;Love this recorder;I recieved the Yamaha 400 series YRA-402B Alto Recorder a couple of weeks ago. I love it. I usually play a 300 series Alto Recorder and I like the 400 series better. The tone is clear and it is easier to sound the high notes. I would highly recommend this recorder. I actually played the 400 series in a performance the week it arrived. Great sound.;5;1/29/2013 10:00
401623;Music Teacher;I love my eco-friendly alto recorder. I was interested in purchasing one after hearing about the soprano model having an excellent tone quality. I purchased the soprano first and was very happy with the sound. Due to the fact that I play alto in an adult recorder ensemble, I wanted to try the alto when it became available. When it arrived, I spent about  30 minutes playing with it and my other Yamaha alto. I felt that the sound quality was better on the ecodear plastic. I end up playing the YRA-402B for a concert the following week. I would highly recommend this recorder.;5;6/15/2013 10:00
401667;Recorders;These recorders are great for your elementary music class. They're durable, sound good, and the cases include the cleaning stick and a fingering chart for students to reference.;5;4/3/2013 10:00

401669;Harmony 3 piece recorder;The 3 piece C soprano recorder is a great fit for my beginning students.  It works well and the kids love the colors.;5;3/1/2012 10:00
401762;Good!;I purchased these and then we have enough for each student to have one from 3rd through 5th grade. The products all come individually wrapped with no blemishes. The strings on the bags are still kind of weak. Good product for a good price!;4;11/5/2012 10:00
401767;Harmony recorders are Super!;I bought a set of 50 to use in my classroom last year. The recorders match to perfect pitch. The students in 4 classes used them every day. They cleaned them after use and put them on my home made recorder stand. Not one of them chipped or cracked. They sounded excellent (when the students played them properly-haha) They have held up very well and I'm purchasing more this year so the students may have their own.;5;8/17/2012 10:00
450452;Nice;Nice;5;2/14/2019 9:41
450701;Best if not wanting to spend over 100 bucks for one;The mouth piece is the best for a reasonable price its great for beginning but later on if you want to make your tone quality better buy a better mouthpiece.;5;11/6/2018 21:08
451170;Reed Revitalizer;I have their reed cases for all my.saxes and clarinets and each pack lasts about 6 months for me in semi-dry SoCal climate. Definitely recommended.;4;12/6/2019 16:41

451484;Just What We Needed;These recorder bags were perfect for labeling recorders that had been donated to our music program. They fit soprano recorders well.;5;2/8/2013 10:00
451484;Great sturdy bag;This was exactly what I was looking for. Great sturdy bag with drawstring to store my classroom set recorders for my students.;5;12/13/2011 10:00
451484;It's in the bag!;I like having extra recorder bags on hand for students who are using a previously owned recorder.  They love to personalize them with sharpies!;5;7/3/2012 10:00
451576;Happy Pick;"Harmony (blue) neckstrap recieved, exactly matches product image. Strap width measures = 3/8"" inches. Simple pull-apart clasp provides a secure interlock. I personally, may not use this neckstrap w/ instrument to hang around my neck very often. Certainly ideal for hanging recorder from a ceiling plant hook (etc.) to dry after use & cleaning. Spring action ajustable plastic slider will slide completely off strap & easily back on...if wanting to use neckstrap for other. A distress/alert whistle (child or adult), spare key, etc. Also suitable for wearing a monocular when outdoors !";5;8/11/2011 10:00
451576;"Great ""helper""!";I bought this to assist a student with physical handicaps be able to hold his Recorder!  Success!  He is happy and I am THRILLED!;5;3/24/2013 10:00

451822;Great aid!;I bought this help a student with physical handicaps be able to hold his Recorder.  It's just what he needed!;5;3/23/2013 10:00
451823;Perfect;Exactly what I needed. The snap-ons work better than those that attach in other ways.;5;4/17/2013 10:00
451823;Good product;This thumbrest helps stabilize the recorder in your hands.  It snaps on easily and is easily adjusted.  It helps me keep my right hand relaxed - a major problem for me.  At this price, how can you lose?;5;6/12/2012 10:00
451824;Tape;"I've bought thumb rests for my recorders. Yes, they slide. They're meant to be adjustable. To prevent sliding, roll a about an inch of Scotch tape up and place it in the thumb rest close enough to your ""right"" spot that a nudge gets it just right. It stays quite well and helps a lot.";4;7/17/2020 17:32
451824;It slides;My thumb rest slides when I use it. If it stayed in one place I would love it, but it slides out of position too easily that it is a pain to use when I play.;1;4/21/2020 21:39
451824;Works great on my Yamaha Tenor;Great product. Easy to put on instrument and stays in place.;5;6/13/2013 10:00
452039;Economical santitizer;Once you purchase the smaller bottles, these refills are awesome. Students   like the minty freshness, and you get a lot for the price.;4;4/25/2012 10:00
452216;Great Long Lasting Valve Oil;I Purchased this valve oil to address a problem of tight valves in my new trumpet.  Valves are now smooth as silk.  The product is easy to dispense and is odorless and non-staining. A Great Product and an Outstanding Value!;5;4/15/2013 10:00
452403;love it;great kit;5;8/13/2020 11:50
452593;I have been using this oil for several years and love it.;This oil is fast and last for a long time. I don't have to re-apply this oil nearly as often as I did with previous standard oils. Now that they have incorporated the child-proof cap, I don't have to worry about the cap coming loose in my soft case pocket and spilling the contents into my case (this happened with the old bottles). This oil seems to be odorless. Until something better comes along, this Hetman 2 Synthetic Medium Piston Lubricant is my oil of choice on my valved brass instruments.;5;6/3/2013 10:00
452731;Nomad bass clarinet stand;It may be small in size but the Nomad bass clarinet stand is sturdy and holds a bass clarinet just fine. I am even using one for my contra-alto clarinet. So far I am very happy with this product.;5;12/3/2011 10:00
452913;Great product;It’s really nice the only thing that I don’t like is that it’s really hard to get on.;5;1/5/2013 10:00
500121;Great stands!;I recommend these stands to my students each year because they work well and the cost is lower than that of the stands they can find at other music stores.;5;12/9/2012 10:00
500121;Music stand review;"Easy to transport and set up.  Only ""complaint"" is that the top piece, the piece that you rest your music book on, comes off really easy when you're trying to move it.  It'd be helpful if it could somehow lock in place.  But otherwise is sturdy and met my expectations.";5;1/23/2013 10:00
500121;Lightweight, but sturdy stands;I have a set of stands similar looking but have had constant issues with them collapsing or getting stuck and it creates a lot of frustration with my little people (Grade 4) who are just learning to use them.  I ordered one of these hoping it was better and indeed it is... it feels quite sturdy and the construction is such to avoid the collapsing issues with the other brand I had.;5;8/13/2018 1:26
500121;Excellent Product;Best music stand I have ever owned. It is super easy to pack up and fold. Very durable, and ightweight. Highly recommend. It can be found on other sights for a higher price but there are multiple colors of this stand.;5;5/6/2020 13:26
500165;Perfect item;Local high school jazz band really needed something to hold their music at outdoor events.  Much better than old wooden clothespins!;5;5/21/2012 10:00
500171;Great Stand!;The product was everything as expected. It is an excellent sturdy stand that holds quite a few things on it. I needed it for a piano student who also plays clarinet. The shipping was first rate and showed up earlier than expected!;5;6/2/2012 10:00
500188;Great for orff and classroom intrument performances;I bought one to see if I really wanted it.  It seems durable and is handy and I need it for performances where my youngest students play boomwhackers or bells or orff or classroom instrument on a carpet on the stage... it allows the audience to see them well (big stands blocked a lot of views) but also puts their music in a good place for them to read it, when we need sheet music.;5;8/13/2018 1:20
500188;Information on stand does not detail what type of assembly is required;Nor does it tell what type of tools will be needed, and whether the stand will have to be put in some odd position while it is put together.  HELP!;5;6/28/2012 10:00
500288;works well!;The music stands will last a long time as they are very sturdy, yet with good adjustments.;5;2/27/2013 10:00
500455;Fast and easy!;This tuner is simple and easy to read. As a music therapy intern I find myself needing to tune the guitar throughout the day and the snark tuner has always been reliable, quick, and accurate.;5;11/4/2011 10:00
500456;Tuner with blinking metronome;Sleek, good looking, easy to use and a huge help to my fledgeling guitar playing escapade....;5;8/1/2012 10:00
500456;Snark SN2 tuner;Wow, it's so easy to use. I really like it.;5;12/19/2011 10:00

500510;Love this tuning fork!;Great price and great tool!;5;2/11/2013 10:00
500510;Great tuning fork with a neckstrap!;Maybe I won't lose my tuning fork now! Thank you, West Music, for a great product at an affordable price.;5;2/10/2013 10:00
500510;A fun way to tune;This little gadget is a handy and fun way to teach tuning and the physics of sound. Works as tuning forks have for generations.;5;9/5/2012 10:00
500515;Excellent metronome!;The metronome showed up earlier than expected and is excellent for my private student who struggles with a metronome on her mother's I Pad currently.;5;6/3/2012 10:00
500640;Encourages Correct Head and Neck Position While Playing;More like 4  1/2 stars, and that is because 2  of the twelve that I bought, experience breakage of the tabs, once inserted through their slits. Oh, yes storage, once assembled can be a problem. Other than that, easy to put together, durable-- and very affordable. I used them with students who sat at desks, while playing recorders and barred instruments.;4;6/14/2019 8:58
500640;Tabletop musical stand;I use these cardboard helpers in my studio on a tabletop and attach a paper clip on top to hold the music in place.Because they are so inexpensive, each of my students gets one for their rhythm cup practicing at home. These stands are easily put together and taken apart for portability. They work great if taken care of, but remember they aren't intended to last forever. Extras come in handy, so order more than you need.;4;11/6/2012 10:00
510659;First Birthday Hit!;My grandson started shaking the box before we could even get the rattles out for him!  He easily held them and shook with both hands. Both held his attention for quite a while and he seemed to be drawn to the black and white.Two thumbs up;5;12/17/2011 10:00
510726;Sounds like fun shake rattle and drum;Easy to handle to play with.;5;10/15/2019 16:10
512425;High quality lanyard at a decent price!;I ordered several lanyards to hold backstage passes for a small music festival. The printed musical notes pattern is fun and the lanyards seem to be of very high quality. I also appreciate that there's both a clasp and a loop for hanging credentials.;5;12/10/2012 10:00
530009;favorite pens;These work well and best of all, they don't smell bad!  My students also enjoy the purple color.;5;2/21/2012 10:00
530065;Handy for quick notation;Even though composition has mostly transferred to computer programs, these notebooks are still most-valuable. They are quite handy for jotting down musical ideas before committing them to a program.  Additionally, kids seem to retain musical ideas when they write them with pencil and paper than programs, making this notebook a must-have.;5;9/6/2012 10:00
530161;I love them but....;i really love these Posters a lot. I would However like to see a poster that just has the primary members of the Woodwind Family on a single poster rather than across several. I would also like to see more individual posters for the percussion posters that way I can specify which ones I would like to show. I would recommend them still! They are really nicely made.;4;1/19/2013 10:00
530190;Excellent teaching tool;"This dry erase board allows me to create a visual tool to help my choir see patterns in their music by isolating short phrases. I can set up this visual aid ahead of rehearsal and place it on a music stand when ready to use it. You can find various ways to use this board with a little planning. I prefer to use commercially available dry erase markers on this board. The board is big enough in size for my choir to see what I have written and small enough to be easy to move. This time, I will be sure to write ""Property of ..."" on the back to minimize the risk of having my new board disappear as my first one did.";5;8/29/2019 15:28
530226;Great;This is so easy to use! It's great! I would recommend this to anyone!;5;7/16/2018 18:23
530260;Plan Book;I LOVE IT!! I've used this book for three years and would be quite reluctant to change.  It has generous blocks for plans, is flexible, and the tips/activities are quite helpful!  I keep them to look at notes made about activities or ideas/tips I tried and liked or didn't like.  Great product!!;5;11/6/2011 10:00
530410;good & basic;"This is a good, basic poster that is super affordable.  It is not cluttered with ""cutesy"" extras, so it is easy for students to understand.  I bought one for each teaching space this year.";5;11/23/2012 10:00
530415;Perfect storage;This guitar rack has been a storage life-saver! Not only is it sleek in design, but it is very easy to move and stores all of my 1/2 and 3/4-sized guitars! I also love how it matches my Wenger Violin/Viola Rack, which I use to store my baritone ukuleles!;5;5/24/2019 13:46
530451;Versatile and Erasable;I'm very pleased with these boards! I use them with my music classes for children from 5 years and up. No matter how hard the children write with the erasable markers, you can wipe the board off easily and thoroughly with a Kleenex or paper towel. I also like the versatility of being able to turn the board over for a clean space (no staff) and we can draw letters, musical symbols, and more. The only drawback I see is the sharp corners, but I caution the children beforehand and make sure they don't pick them up and wave them around. We use them on the floor (carpet) and I don't worry about needing a stiff backing like I do with staff paper. Saves money on other kinds of staff paper. I would order these again in a minute!;5;3/27/2012 10:00
530482;Gameplan is awesome!;This is a great curriculum! My students love the activities in it! The props, activities, and large books help give the students a more hands on and visual learning experience.;5;10/4/2012 10:00

530575;Beautiful visuals;I have most of these visuals printed and posted up in my music classroom. They are perfect for the elementary music room and the designs are on point. Well done Fun with Composers!;5;10/12/2021 13:01
530629;Excellent Product!;This recorder program is one of the best I have ever seen.  It is well laid out.   The graphics are adorable.  I am very excited to begin using this with my students!;5;10/14/2012 10:00
530659;Captivating!;I was looking for a recorder activity that would engage my students in my structured learning class (class for students with autism) and Johnny Jazz was a smashing hit on day one! Students in my SLC class are typically distracted and have difficulty doing full group instruction, and the first day I introduced Johnny Jazz all the students were fully engaged and answering questions that are brought up on the “partner share” slides. I even was able to get them to create movements for one of the songs. I look forward to continuing to explore the curriculum and use it with my 4th grade gen ed class! Thank you Tim!;5;4/10/2013 10:00
530659;Johnny Jazz the Recorder Raider;"Oh my gosh, my kids were mesmerized by Johnny Jazz! They absolutely loved it, especially the boys!! When we got to the end of the story they said, ""A cliffhanger?! That must mean there is a sequel. When is the sequel coming out?!!! This recorder method book / comic book is a hit. Your students will love it!";5;5/20/2020 22:16
530659;The kids love it;My 3rd grade students have been totally captivated by Johnny! They love the story and the graphics. And yes, they love playing the songs as well.;5;4/22/2021 21:45
530659;Johnny Jazz the Recorder Raider;My students loved the story of Johnny Jazz.  They eagerly watched  Dr. Tritonian hatching his evil plan. They loved the graphics, the superhero plot, and loved predicting what would happen next.  My less-engaged kids were super excited to see the next section of the story each class.  Through the story, all students were engaged and eager to play recorder along with Johnny Jazz as he battled Dr. Tritonian.;4;4/29/2020 12:09
530659;Turned my Program Around;I had been struggling to teach recorder to my 3rd graders in an engaging and exciting way.  I attended a conference lead by Tim Wiegand, learned about Johnny Jazz, and knew I HAD to get it for my students.  Fast forward to the following school year when I introduced this curriculum...students were excited to learn recorder, excited to come to my class and couldn't wait to learn what happens next.  They ask me frequently if the next Johnny Jazz chapter is out yet - can't wait to see it!;5;1/15/2020 14:37
530659;Johnny Jazz saves the music;If you are looking for a recorder activity to excite your students....then look no further! The graphics, recorder backtracks, and story line are phenomenal! There are several opportunities for student discussion, creative movement, and singing included as well! Dr. Tritonium will never prevail as long as Johnny Jazz and Ms. Melody are around to save the music!!;5;1/24/2020 21:39
530659;STUDENTS LOVED IT;"From the minute I learned about this curriculum, I knew I had to get it for my students! Graphic novels are very popular and engaging at the 4th grade level.
I was so excited when my students exclaimed for more when we finished! Through this curriculum, students are not only engaged by the story, but are also challenged to play well! My students have become wonderful sight-readers and more independent musicians because of this program. I encourage you to buy it now!";5;5/10/2019 21:10
530659;Wonderfully Unique;My students have been very excited with this program! This is a unique approach for teaching the recorder that I believe will increase their music reading and recorder playing skills. This is my 20th year of teaching music and the students are completely on task and engaged.;5;2/25/2020 19:14
530659;Kids love it;My students are loving Johnny Jazz! I've been using it as a reward for when they stay on task. At the end of class, they get to find out what happens next in the comic. Great supplement to any recorder curriculum.;5;4/10/2019 11:02
530666;Music Madness;I don't have a smart board and this is perfect for a projectable laptop to whiteboard.  these games never get boring.  I teach k-4;5;2/2/2020 20:03
530739;The Doctor Wrote the Book;These cards are a fun way to enter improvisational music making with a group, no matter what level of musicianship. Dr. Oshinsky wrote the book, Return to Child, which covers the basics on how to improve your musicianship, play with others and facilitate music circles. The cards offer visuals and simple creative ideas to inspire playing music in the moment. There are many ideas to strengthen your own musicianship as well as with others to develop communication and spontaneity. A wonderful tool for music facilitators.;5;7/8/2021 11:40
540002;Gigantic and Awesome;I was looking for different sizes scarves for my students to use while we perform theatrical vignettes to music.  These canopy scarves are GIGANTIC, my students love them, and they are really great quality! I am extremely pleased with this purchase, and I know I could NEVER make them in this size without paying way more.;5;1/16/2013 10:00
540003;great sticks;This work wonderfully for a great number of rhythm activities!;5;10/5/2012 10:00
540027;Bear Paw Creek is awesome!;Bear Paw Creek's products are the highest quality children's movement props around! They are all made in the USA. Stretchy bands are excellent for addressing awareness of others, following directions, working as a team, and even academic concepts.;5;11/25/2011 10:00
540029;Great product;This will provide my toddler music class with some great activities for songs!;5;7/13/2012 10:00
540030;Happy Elementary Music Teacher;"This product is so great for the Elementary Music Classroom. Since, I received this product a few weeks ago, we have been working on form and dynamics for all of my grades (Kindergarten through 5th Grade.) The students love it! I am so glad that I got the Extra Large stretchy band for my classroom. My class size is anywhere from 18 to 22 students. It's perfect for them knowing that they won't have to ""share a color"" and have their very own to use. Just another great way to connect music to students!";5;3/13/2013 10:00
540031;Perfect for toddlers!;Fun and colorful!  Just right for 1 to 3 year olds.  The handles make these much safer than the streamers on sticks.;5;12/28/2011 10:00
540031;Beautiful Streamers;These are very well made, and have a nice handle that will be easy for me to clean between uses.;5;10/26/2012 10:00

540050;Beethpven Bear;I am a piano teacher and Beethoven Bear is a great assistant in getting a student to practice their piano lesson.  I am very pleased with it and will be re-ordering in the near future.  Linda;5;9/21/2012 10:00
540053;Wonderful for kids;kids love moving to music so this is an excellent for artistic expression.  Beautiful and durable scarves.  This is a great product.;5;3/7/2012 10:00
540053;27 inch scarves;Wonderful colors and made nicely.  Perfect size.;5;1/5/2012 10:00
540053;Nice for use with any age;These scarves are colorful and light enough to float freely on the air.  I have used them with 4 year olds and Kindergarteners and had success with both groups.  Children love moving with the music.;5;10/28/2011 10:00
540053;Best flowers/flyers ever!!;"?I teach Musikgarten classes in my studio and scarves are an essential in every class. Nothing thrills a child like getting to play with a colorful scarf! I have ordered from several different sources and have found that the fabric West Music uses makes the best 'flowers' (wadding them up in your hand to form the bud, then slowly opening the hand to produce the flower). Also, these scarves make the best 'flyers' (throwing them up in the air with a big ""Whee !!"" and watching them fly around, then slowly fall to the floor). I  keep  extras of these scarves on hand for selling to the Moms because they want the kind that 'flowers' and 'fliers' like the ones we've used in class. Children love to pick a scarf in their favorite color and these sets have beautiful colors that are sure to please everyone?";5;11/7/2012 10:00
540053;Love My Scarves;I love using these scarves for my music therapy sessions and early childhood music classes! They are great movement props!;5;9/1/2011 10:00
540076;Cooerative Blanket huge success!;I purchased this item for my Pre-K aftercare classroom.  It provides fun ways for individual children to move and make shapes.  It also provides just the right resistance and core strengthening opportunity for children to find their own way to move inside.  Great for sensory integration and realignment.  I highly recommend the  cooperative blanket in any classroom.;5;10/10/2012 10:00
540088;Decent, but tangle easily;These are nice quality but you must teach children to not twist the streamer around the stick. If they do, then the ribbons knot easily. In our first class using them over half the ribbons had multiple knots after the movement was done;3;9/8/2021 7:27
540088;Perfect for Little hands;Thers work for my Kinder/first grade<br />they are colorful and perform well!;5;5/25/2012 10:00

540292;Hemmed Scarves;We use the scarves with Drums Alive. They are lightweight and colorful.  A great product!;5;6/11/2013 10:00
550018;Great game!;Excellent classroom resource;5;12/26/2012 10:00
550038;Great Resource!;"I love these manipulatives for practicing writing rhythms. I have my students ""write"" the rhythms on the Beat Strips and then transfer them with paper and pencil. It helps them see what rhythm symbols add up to four beats. I made half note cards to add to them for my older students.";5;2/6/2013 10:00

550131;Great for musicians and music enthusiast;A very unexpected twist to a famous game. Pulling out notes after a band rehearsal or other occasion is quite a joy. Not the overused train or regular dominoes game. Had a lot of fun;5;12/14/2019 13:40
640152;Peavey Sound System;The sound system is great and has a clear sound. Easy to assemble and self explanatory. An amateur will look like a professional.;5;5/11/2013 10:00
660384;Great product for price;Ordered this to do a small venue and it works great!! Awesome price too.;5;5/9/2013 10:00
660459;"Pretty Happy as an alternative to expensive ""Beats""";I enjoy them because they work with everything. My phone, my apple tv, etc.. They work as they should and have great sound. I'm still getting used to them. Maybe cause I'm old or there is not enough buttons but I'm just having trouble memorizing what buttons do what, the sequence of pressing I need to do to turn on, pair, and off, and what the light indicates. I have to keep referring to the directions.;4;1/24/2013 10:00
660474;Smallish Music Teachers Rejoice;I am of small stature, and definitely not blessed with upper body strength. Setting up for school assemblies used to require standing on chairs, using carts for leverage, etc. Now the process is SO much easier. My only complaint is how difficult it is to get the stand back down once it is up. Still, this product has completely saved my back - thank you!;4;8/30/2018 10:37
690021;Love it;Really great for the price. The sound is great once you plug them in. These headphones are amazing.;5;1/31/2013 10:00
690111;Baby Ear Muffs;while these did work to quiet the noise from fireworks, we could not put them on. We had to hold them on his ears. The strap would cover his eyes if the muffs were placed properly. He didn't like that. So we just held them in place. No directions on how to put them on.;4;8/14/2011 10:00
750850;Amazing cable!;The Pig Hog Instrument Cables don't disappoint. I purchased the seaform green, 20 feet right angle cable, and it's simply perfect. Beautiful, vivid color, fantastic clarity, and no latency noticed in the sound. I'm in love with this new cable, and I couldn't be happier to purchase it from West Music!;5;1/10/2012 10:00
800164;Great book;Love this book - have used it for years - my students buy it in 4th grade.     AND love that it is on Smartmusic software - the ONLY elementary method book on it.     I like using Smartmusic with my music readers - helps all of them track the notes in the measures when they light up.    Good collection of songs and nice accompaniments.;5;9/25/2011 10:00
800164;Easy to use the train theme on bulletin boards to help with assessment.;I've used this method for 2 years and use the SmartMusic program along with it to help with assessment.  The students seem to respond well to the independence of testing themselves.  It also feeds into our band program method which also uses SmartMusic. I purchased 450 copies of the book so students can borrow a book to take home from now on.;5;10/19/2011 10:00
800164;Love this Book!;My kids love the book! The songs are in a great and natural progression for young or advanced players alike. The variety of songs are great for classroom practice and for concert performances!;5;1/14/2013 10:00
800164;Recorder Express;I love Artie Almeida, her book, and her style.;5;12/4/2012 10:00
800164;Good Content;The content is quite good, but my fourth graders thought that the graphics were a bit immature.;5;11/12/2012 10:00
802971;Excellent beginning book for proficient musician learning recorder;This series introduces notes in a very sequential way. There are plenty of exercises to solidify muscle memory when switching notes so you get a clean sound. Don't skip exercises even though you think you are beyond them!;5;6/14/2013 10:00
802980;Playing Alto Recorder;This is a good beginners book, shows were the student should breath while playing. The fingering chart in the back is a little hard to read but this book is better than some books for playing the alto recorder.;4;7/5/2012 10:00
802986;Love this series!;Great way to introduce concepts in order of easy to more difficult;5;6/12/2013 10:00
803940;Wonderful Resource!;This is a creative and inspirational resource for using and extending nursery rhymes for teaching purposes in your classroom!! The rhymes and activities are geared toward students in K-3rd. I definitely recommend purchasing this volume, and the other 2 nursery rhyme volumes by Kriske and DeLelles as well!;5;8/21/2012 10:00
803945;Love this resource!!;This is an amazing resource for using and extending nursery rhymes for teaching purposes in your classroom!! The ideas are so wonderful, and I love how it reinforces the cultural piece of nursery rhymes, which students are not as familiar with nowadays. The rhymes and activities are geared toward students in K-3rd. I definitely recommend purchasing this volume, and the other 2 nursery rhyme volumes by Kriske and DeLelles as well!;5;8/22/2012 10:00
803946;Excellent resource!;The book is a must for integrating traditional holiday expectations and valid music education.;5;9/6/2011 10:00
803948;"bought to use one; will end up using two!";I had originally ordered this to use Bremen Town Musicians with my fifth graders, but in the interim, we got a new student from China, so am thrilled that Tikki Tikki Tembo is part of this book!  Plan to use both as part of an end of the school year world music program.;5;10/20/2011 10:00
803949;Creative Lessons;I bought this resource because of the creative lesson ideas for songs I already using in my teaching.  This particular book also had several original songs/poems which I will probably not use.  I did think it was worth the price for the few lessons I will use as they are really strong.;4;5/5/2012 10:00
803950;Wonderful resource!!;I LOVE all the nursery rhyme-inspired books by Kriske and DeLelles!! This one is just as wonderful as the first two, with its fun extension ideas for nursery rhymes and easy to follow lesson plans. I really like how each one shows the suggested grade level and concepts it aims to teach. The rhymes and activities are geared toward students in K-5th. I definitely recommend purchasing this volume, and the other 2 nursery rhyme volumes by Kriske and DeLelles as well!;5;8/23/2012 10:00
804066;Used in World Music performance by fifth graders;"I have used the Blind Men and the Elephant several times now, with my fifth graders, as part of a world music show.  Our art teacher worked with a group of students and created an ""elephant"" using a rolling white board as the frame!  The staging is very creative and the music is very accessible. I also added the Indian piece, Bhawaiya from Recorders Without Borders by Stern. I have not had a need to use any of the other stories yet, but if the Blind Men and the Elephant was the only story in the book, it would be worth the price!";5;2/23/2013 10:00
804129;Well organized curriculum;Having taken an overview workshop only, the plethora of materials provided allow for a comprehensive approach to teaching music literacy. I am looking forward to digging in and following the systematic approach of introducing a rhythmic and melodic foundation.;5;12/8/2012 10:00
804983;Nice resource;I have been using this book for over 10 years in my summer school recorder class and it works well for the students.;5;1/9/2012 10:00

812169;Great Reference for Gullah Culture;My Granddaughter is very interested in African-American history and culture, and this is a great reference.  Also. I teach music to pre-schoolers and bought myself a copy for teaching them songs. Was referred to this book and also the musical group Ranky Tanky by an NPR radio interview on Fresh Air.;4;2/20/2013 10:00
812192;good resource book;I like this book because it has multiple songs that can be played using the boomwhackers.;5;8/30/2011 10:00
812886;Good book for Junior High;We have used this book many years now for our Junior High students in their general music class.  The students also play handbells and have a piano proficiency requirement.  The format of the book allows our students to essentially work at their own speed.  We have been very pleased with the results.;4;10/2/2019 12:30
814652;Wonderful music & wonderful book;I used this in my home with my own two children and in my classroom while teaching. I am buying it again, only now it’s for grandchildren!! Such a valuable resource to teach about and honor/remember our ancestors!!;5;8/21/2019 8:59
814653;Yes - I would recommend.;"I recently discovered this classic storybook set. My 1st grade students are surprisingly engaged while singing and listening to the recordings of each story. I page through the storybook with my students while the track plays instead of using the video. The audio is simple compared to the ""in your face"" technology of today - and I think that's why it's so effective. The content is great at reinforcing the So-Mi concept. Each story is concise, entertaining, and worth a look.";5;1/17/2019 10:01
815009;Great Resource;Good canons and 3-part songs.;5;4/16/2012 10:00
815022;Let us Praise God;Looking forward to using this my students.;5;1/6/2012 10:00
815586;Basic recorder technique vol. 2 alto recorder;While the book says it's for alto recorders it seems more like a continuation of vol 1 for soprano recorders.  Still it's a good book and I'll make use of the tunes it contains.;4;7/4/2012 10:00
815757;Enjoyable and impressive.;"My 3rd and 4th grade recorders enjoyed the songs, and the CD accompaniments made rehearsal/performance a breeze. We did the advanced ""Ding Dong Merrily on High"" and ""The Little Drummer BAG."" (""Drummer BAG"" had a heavy-metal feel and ""Ding Dong"" was a challenge for 4th grade) but they DID it! I felt really good about their finished product.";5;9/20/2011 10:00
815782;Fantastic;I love this product.  I've used it with my 3rd grade music classes for three years.  Excellent tips for teaching the beginning several days of recorder and technique before you get to the songs.  The highlight of this curriculum for me was using electrical tape for the belts.  My boys loved the competition and were more into playing their recorders well than my girls.  I combined this course with another course (can't remember the name) that used one song for one note.  Second song for two notes.  Three songs for three notes.  These practiced rhythm only.  By the time we started our first song Hot Cross Buns they were really ready.;5;3/5/2013 10:00
815949;Fantastic resource for patriotic music;I love these big books as they are large enough to read the words and cheaply see the pictures in a large class. The pictures are nice and clear. You can color it how you'd like then laminate and place back in the comb binding. I also love the master copy you can use to create class mini books fir each child. Wonderful literacy and patriotic songs connections as well as American symbols of freedom.;5;12/29/2012 10:00
816234;Great compilation of songs;Love this book for song ideas for seniors!;5;9/10/2012 10:00
816658;Pandemonium Rules;This is excellent for marimba band, too, and I have used Linstead Market and Rivers of Babylon with my 4-5-6th grade bands for years. In my opinion, there are better pieces for 3rd and 4th graders to work on, like the first three or four in each of Walt Hampton's books, Shumba Panzira in one of Jon Madin's books, and basic arrangements of Amazing Grace and Michael Row the Boat with melody, chords and bass.  However, 3rd and 4th graders can readily learn Linstead Market and Rivers of Babylon if they are part of a mixed marimba band with 5th and 6th graders.  Rivers of Babylon is absolutely essential repertoire--one of the great classics.  Play the Melodians' version for your students, which is the source for the Panemonium version.;5;7/30/2011 10:00
816679;fantastic engaging resource;"This book has been the basis of my recorder teaching for a few years now. It is great for engaging all of the students, not just the ones who love music.

It slows the pace of learning just enough to make it accessible to all students, and allows the students to gain coordination, and tone in their recorder playing.  As they gain confidence, it is then possible to challenge them with more notes, and more challenging music.


the movement, and improvisation, and history lessons are fun, and interesting, and have great variety.

I have formatted many of my own lessons after the model this outlines. It has had a big influence on my teaching.";5;7/5/2018 8:40
816679;Best CD for Teaching Recorder;I have had about 6 of these CD's over my career and have done a fair amount of creating my own songs to go with these accompaniment pieces.  There is a book that goes with the CD but I have chosen to let my own creative spirit create some new songs for my students.  Several of these also include perfect opportunities for students to do some practice on improvisation.  This CD is now a favorite of mine when I substitute teach and work with students on the recorder.  I would recommend that any elementary music teacher buy this CD and let your imaginations fly.;5;2/12/2019 11:13
821066;A great bridge;This book has excellent resources for the Kodaly classroom. It's scope and sequence gives an age appropriate introduction of fundamental musical content for older elementary students. I was a little surprised that they focus on MRD instead of SML, but it's fine with me, I'll just roll with it and I'm sure my students will be great. This is an expensive resource, but it is worth every penny.;5;11/12/2011 10:00
821066;Straight forward and accessible;This is very straight forward and easy to adapt. I think it might be a little more challenging to navigate if you have absolutely no familiarity with Kodaly lesson planning. Fun song selection but a few options are too obviously drinking songs and such for me to use with my kids. There are plenty of options however within each unit and the fact that you can copy the mystic for your classes makes this a very cost effective resource!;5;1/28/2012 10:00
824301;At last;This product is long overdue. The ever-increasing interest worldwide in choral singing has emphasised the need for a rational approach to learning to sight-read. Thank you.;5;5/19/2012 10:00
825653;Great dances and easy to learn;This book contains a variety of circle dances that can be used with all ages and grades.  Most dances have ideas for differentiation to allow students of all abilities to participate and find success.;5;12/11/2018 16:06
825653;Fun and engaging lessons;Phylis Weikart does an amazing job with this book!  There are so many different dances from all different origins that go along with different styles of music.  There are dances ranging from beginner to more advanced levels or experience.  Each dance has a step-by-step guide to the different movements, how many beats each step takes, which feet you move and which direction you are moving in.  The back of the book has a glossary of dance and movement-specific terms you see used throughout the book.  I am a K-8 General Music teacher and this is one book I feel like I could use in every class I teach.  It is well worth the money and I am glad I discovered it.;5;10/8/2012 10:00
826441;A Basic Resource for Using Orff Instruments;Excellent resource for the use of the Orff instruments that are provided by your school.  Also very adaptable if you don't have all the Orff instruments that are used in the lessons.  Great for inspiration to help you develop your own Orff instrumentation.;4;8/10/2012 10:00
827843;Excellent Resource;The Game Plan curriculum is an excellent tool for any K-5 classroom. While most activities in the lessons can be completed as they are, you'll have to make some modifications to fit the needs of your students and your time limits. The curriculum itself is great, and I occasionally substitute some of the songs in the lessons for others since I didn't buy any of the supplemental materials. It's a great tool if you're looking for some guidelines for your K-5 music class!;5;4/2/2013 10:00
828347;Excellent resource;Did many of these dances as part of conversational solfege training and had a blast!;5;2/21/2013 10:00
828365;Plays Well Together;Margaret teaches at World Music Drumming.  Her process is flawless.  I love how she writes things for soprano and simple alto recorder.  Her materials are well thought out and fun!;5;8/10/2011 10:00
828383;Fun with Composers. Volume 1;I have been using this product for years and can’t say enough good things about it!! The children LOVE learning about composers and their music.  Fun with Composers allows storytelling and music to come together!  It has allowed classical music to come alive and be in the hearts of children once again.;5;10/12/2021 15:46
828383;Awesome;I absolutely love the “Fun With Composers” series of books! They teach so many music concepts, history, reading skills, movement to music and the songs are are absolutely adored by my students. The lesson plans are incredible, and so easy to understand!  Love the videos too!!;5;10/12/2021 17:28
828434;Excellent source for songs in Spanish!;Vamos a cantar is wonderful collection of songs in Spanish from almost every country in Latin America and Spain. It is well organized in level of difficulty, themes, and tone set which helps a lot in case you are a Kodaly-inspired teacher. I was amazed by the research done by Faith Knowles and the quality of the book and the songs. Also, comes with a wonderful CD with songs in the book. I was lucky enough to find a copy in Westmusic because seems that now is a bit hard to get so if you see it somewhere  do not hesitate and get it!;5;12/10/2011 10:00
832892;Great resource;Great activities with lots of reproducible images in the back to use various activities. Most activities have additional variations depending on what works best for your class and setup.;5;12/5/2018 13:49
833139;A unique challenge for intermediate players!;This book features some of Orff's more popular and colorful compositions arranged for piano duet (one piano, four hands).  The arrangements are easy enough for the intermediate player to handle, but the challenge lies in the rhythm of the duets.  Each duet explores more uncommon time signatures and various meter changes that require concentration and strict time, allowing the players to flex their ensemble playing muscle.  The arrangements avoid the sometimes extremely thick textures of Orff's music while remaining loyal to the melody and/or colorful harmonies of the orchestral score. Fun to play and unique in comparison to much of the standard piano duet repertoire out there today, this book was a breath of fresh air to explore.;5;10/13/2012 10:00
834216;EXCELLENT;"If you're looking for more than those ""Hot Cross Buns"", this is your book.
The songs start out simply so that note naming is not an issue and are able to focus on reading from a score. There are a lot of repeating parts for mastery, but it is not boring!
And I cannot say enough about the background tracks!  The kids sound so awesome and they feel accomplished!  Try this book.  You will not be disappointed!";5;2/19/2019 10:09
834250;Fantastic selection of standard hymns;I love the arrangements of these classic hymns. The perfect addition to my music catalog.;5;4/4/2013 10:00
834251;Songs of Faith Volume 1: Accompaniment/Choral Edition;"Very helpful in our senior citizen retirement community where we have a weekly worship time.  This volume enables us to sing more comfortably because the hymns are in keys lower than the traditional ones.  Hard for us old folks to hit anything above the ""C"" above middle ""C.""";5;2/17/2012 10:00
834422;Happy students and teacher;There is nothing more fun than the Fun with composers materials. The lesson plans are geared for how kids learn- and they use their imaginations and MOVE- all at the same time learning musical concepts. I highly recommend this product.;5;10/12/2021 12:45
834422;Fun with Composers series;My students love the playfulness of Fun with Composers stories and activities, especially those who love to move & pretend to be characters. I love how musically rich and educational the lessons are.;5;10/12/2021 12:36
835365;Pictures as beautiful as the music;Mike Wimmer's illustrations perfectly compliment the lyrics and tune of the ethereal lullaby.  I've used the book many times to give children a visual to help them connect to the song as it is sung.  I've done the same with adults.  Everyone loves this book.;5;9/5/2019 2:40
835952;Almost ready-made program;Love this book! With 6 countries to visit and the familiar jingle bells tune to guide you, this book is great for reading at Christmas or to expand into a program exploring how Christmas is celebrated around the world. There are ready - made speaking parts in the back explaining each country's  traditions, and all lyrics on one page ready to send home for practice. All you need to do is plug in repertoire that matches the abilities of your students and the length of your program. You could use all 6 countries or just a few, could use it as a singalong with a class or a community. The inclusive representations of children in the book are also great.;5;11/5/2019 6:50
836387;Musical was a huge success;"It [Freddie the Frog and the Mighty Meter Gnome] was a huge success with over 450 family members out for the night program. There was 160 Kindy and First-graders singing the songs (with motions) and eight fifth-grade cast members speaking the parts of the play.
We also had specials; first grade can-can dancers... first-grade blue beetle bug blues singers (complete with blues brothers sunglasses and plastic microphones) and first-grade chanting army ants.
It was a lot of fun, and I feel confident that when we review the musical concepts next year the students will have a much deeper appreciation and recognition.";5;7/29/2011 10:00
836682;Good Resource, But Overpriced;I have the first Choral Builders book and have used it K-12.  It's a great resource and is worth the price.  This book is very thin in comparison, and feels more like a money grab.   There are 20 exercises in the book, and they are definitely appropriate for elementary-aged students, but I think the money is better spent on the first book.;3;9/11/2011 10:00
836752;Treasure from Orff Attic;This book has so many ways to include small group activities, improvisation and body percussion.  Also, the orff arrangements are easy enough to learn in one lesson.;5;9/17/2012 10:00
836992;Spanish language folk songs;This is a comprehensive folk song book that includes an Audio CD with children singing the songs beautifully. The illustrations are in black and white, and useful for children who wish to color them. It also has a language guide in the back in case a person wishes to learn how to pronounce the words. Additionally, it provides complete translations and cultural background for each song.;5;11/13/2011 10:00
837383;Behind Bars;This book is full of great stuff!;5;11/21/2012 10:00
838424;Ukulele in the Classroom;"It is a well thought out method.  It takes the ukulele seriously and does not ""dumb it down,""  Am currently trying it out with the first middle school class at our school to ever learn to play the ukulele.  Am pleased with the emphasis on reading notation and learning to play melody on the ukulele first.  The only drawback is that if you are used to the ukulele being tuned with re-entrant tuning (all strings tuned within a single octave-gCEA), and would like to maintain that inimitable sound, the book does not accommodate this tuning well.  Though it says it will.  As a result, to give the method the full benefit of the doubt, I am ordering the Low G string to see how this plays out in the long run.  (However, because of this, I am giving the book 4 rather than 5 stars).  The aim is to give students an instrument which they can enjoy playing, and on which they will be able to make music knowledgeably and readily.  The hope is they will take this instrument with them after middle school and expand their playing skills, or use it as a stepping stone to playing other strummed instruments. So far, so good!";4;5/14/2013 10:00
838426;Awesome thank you very much;We will buy a lot more stuff from you for our music school. Shipping was fast too;5;10/16/2012 10:00
839232;"""Must Have""";When you need a lesson that will prove to be an instant success, engage children, AND teach musical concepts, this is THE book for you!  Easy to follow process and good old fashioned fun! This is one of my favorite resources!;5;4/5/2012 10:00
839232;Parachutes and Ribbons and Scarves oh My!;I love this resource! It always engages my students!;5;6/1/2012 10:00
839232;BUY THIS BOOK! You will have no regrets.;I will be using every one of these at some point this year. Easy to follow and adapt. GREAT resource!;5;11/28/2012 10:00
839243;ukeing Disney style;Nice easy read.  Good choice for the kids and kids at heart.;5;8/26/2012 10:00
839883;Excellent Curriculum;This has offered me many ideas on how to structure my kindergarten music class next year. I can't wait to begin Game Plan with them!;5;6/5/2013 10:00
840239;A Must-Have Orff Resource;I love this series of Orff projects so much I bought a second set as a gift for a first year music teacher.  This second book is my second favorite of the three.  Each folk song is marked for the suggested grade level, the Sol-Fa used in the song, and has a suggested game/activity as well as the Orff activity.  If you have limited funds, this is the resource to buy!;5;3/9/2013 10:00
840914;Music For Special Kids;This was really helpful in working with my non-verbal autistic students. Instead of giving a lengthy overview of autism, it provides lots of useful lesson components and activities.;5;11/10/2012 10:00
841057;Show Stoppers;This book is a fresh, new and innovative collection of Orff ensembles for the Music Classroom.  I am currently working on the song, A Splash of Blue, with my Middle School music classes.  They enjoy the rhythms and upbeat music of this piece.  We marched around the school today showing off their new piece.  Loads of fun!  The CD is useful as well.  Each song includes a good number of teaching ideas, concepts, and other good suggestions.;5;8/1/2011 10:00
841323;Especially Wonderful for K-2;I love everything about the K, 1, 2 curriculum. I can't make it through the books in a year, but I can pick and choose what activities I need to support learning. The big books, boxes of manipulatives and listening activities are very engaging. 3, 4, and 5 incorporate lots of recorder, but have great activities and resources for use throughout the year.;4;4/1/2019 11:28
841367;Amazing Musical!;I highly recommend this musical.  I taught it over a period of 3 months to my third and fourth grade students.  The fourth grade students were responsible for the Orff instrumentation, narrating, and acting.  My third grade students were responsible for learning the dances.<br /><br />My students enjoyed this so much, and we received many compliments from parents and teachers.  The kindergarten students even wanted to learn the songs and dances.  The only issue is that I do not know how I'm going to top it next year!!!;5;8/4/2011 10:00

842371;Love this book;I saw Mary Amidon this fall and was amazed!  This book and Cd are on constant replay in my car for my four and two year old.  AND I can stand to listen to it too!  Great lessons for preschoolers that work!!!;5;8/12/2011 10:00
842371;Superb!;Fabulous collection!  I just received it and immediately used several of the songs/movements in my music classroom.  A wonderful value—you get the book, a CD, and a DVD that demonstrates the vast majority of things in the book.  A valuable resource!;5;5/13/2013 10:00
842371;Love this collection!;I have used this collection a ton with my K-2 music classes.  The CD is really high quality.  The kids love the songs.  I always keep a few of these songs/activities in mind in case the other things I've planned for the day run short and I need to fill a few extra minutes.  Some activities would probably work for older grades too, I just happen to only teach K-2.;5;4/19/2013 10:00
842520;Bought for my daughter;My daughter is an elementary school music teacher who heard songs from this book at a workshop and wanted to use them in her classroom. I bought it as a gift for her and she is very pleased!;5;9/20/2012 10:00
842521;Wonderful resource for all music teachers;"""Making Music Cooperatively - Using Cooperative Learning in Your Active Music-Making Classroom"" has changed the way I teach and the way my students learn.  Carol has done an excellent job explaining the principles of cooperative learning and guiding the music teacher in how to be successful implementing it in the music classroom.

I have used cooperative learning principles in my classroom for years now, but after reading Carol's book, this was the first year I intentionally ""set the stage"" by creating lessons specifically designed to help the children learn how to work in small groups effectively.  Carol's advice on creating a kindness zone, teaching a variety of conflict resolution skills, and helping students develop listening skills when working together has made a tremendous difference in my classroom this year.  Her examples of cooperative learning structures as applied to the music room were also extremely helpful.

While setting up a Cooperative Learning classroom takes a commitment of time and energy when creating units and lesson plans, the rewards are well worth the effort.  ""Making Music Cooperatively"" is a wonderful resource to help any teacher, whether a beginner or veteran,  create a rich learning environment in which students and teachers can grow together.";5;7/28/2011 10:00
842723;ANNIE KIDS PLAY;I received the musical very fast!  We were ready to start when it arrived!;5;12/7/2012 10:00
843327;loved finding this!;I was so excited to find this Chinese folktale and plan to use it with my fifth grade general music classes in their study of Chinese music.;5;10/21/2011 10:00
843437;This Is A Great Resource!;I found the songs in this collection to be a wonderful addition to my classroom library. The instrument parts are perfect for the elementary classroom, just at their level!;5;3/2/2012 10:00
844109;Awesome recorder book;This book is a life saver! The children love the various rhythms and don't want to leave the music class. They ask to play the songs many times. Excellent material for recorder! You will not regret purchasing this book.;5;8/3/2012 10:00
844235;This book is GREAT!;Tim Weigand's latest book is brilliant!  When I received my copy and flipped through it, I wanted to grab my recorder an start playing!  I can't wait to share this with my classroom!  I may even start recorders early this year!  I am so excited to use something fresh and new.  Viegansong products are always worth it!;5;7/23/2011 10:00
844349;Perfecto;"A must read book for any musicians that enjoy history and golden era in mexico and good history on the beginning of great Mexican musicians (our idols)  narrated by some one who was there.
Un libro que debe leer si es musicol y le interesa la epoca de oro en mexico, y es dicha por alguien que vivio y crecio con nuestro idols y cantantes mexicanos

844350;I Know a Shy Fellow Who Swallowed a Cello - Paperback;"Super cute book based on the original story ""I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly.""  The great thing about this book is that it is MUSIC/instrument based, so it's a wonderful read for your instrument unit and the students love it!";5;5/25/2013 10:00
844366;Brilliant technique resource for beginning and experienced choirs!;I stumbled upon this gem while at the 2014 NAfME conference in Nashville. I do not have an accompanist for my elementary choir, so it is nice to find a warm-up resource that allows me to step away from the piano and get into my choir while warming up.  This warm-up book covers EVERYTHING with some really nice songs that my students do not get bored with.  I love that it is plastic/spiral bound and will fit on the music stand and stay open, and will turn easily. The CD has not only the music but the warm ups ready to show the choir on a projector screen or copy.;5;8/31/2011 10:00
845196;Recorder Revolutions Book and Interactive Whiteboard CD Pack;"So excited!  As I listened to the accompaniments and began to review the pieces in this book, I was thrilled to see a musical style that will be relevant to my students. Although I enjoy the current recorder curriculum that we are using in the classroom, many of the songs feel like "" little kid"" songs to my students. In contrast, the songs in Music Revolutions are upbeat with modern accompaniments and orff arrangements that my students will think are ""cool"". That makes this a win!  It will also be very helpful to have a powerpoint presentation with embedded accompaniments and examples (Although the materials came with interactive files, I don't have a smart-board, so I was relieved to see that there were also power-point files). I am looking forward to trying these pieces with students.";5;4/21/2013 10:00
845196;Amazing Resource!;This resource is amazing!  The songs progress in a logical sequence for kids, the great accompaniments make the songs even more enjoyable, and the whiteboard visuals and posters make the teacher's life so much easier.  You can simply project the song and everything is right there for you.  You and your students will LOVE using this resource!;5;2/19/2012 10:00
845196;I'd give this 10 stars if I could;"Tim Wiegand is a fantastic music educator who brings a modern spin on teaching the recorder. My kids absolutely love the accompaniment tracks, and I love how diverse the styles are. You can teach so many music concepts besides recorder with this resource! I love how he starts simple with one note in each song so you can work on technique and rhythm, then adds a new note at appropriate times. I love that there are opportunities to sing. I love that he adds movement suggestions. I love the Level Up concept. It focuses them in on the more difficult concepts and they want to become more and more advanced!

I am using this with my 3rd and 4th graders this year, and I definitely recommend getting the interactive pack. It's so valuable! I can see how over time you could use this for 3rd and 4th and then get Johnny Jazz for the more advanced 5th graders. This would also be GREAT curriculum for a recorder club or ensemble.

I cannot recommend this curriculum highly enough!!";5;5/16/2019 10:17
845196;Revolutions Book and Interactive Whiteboard CD Pack;"Are you looking for something fresh and new for your recorder classroom? Tim Weigand's Recorder Revolutions Book and Interactice Whiteboard tools are for you! This is fresh and fun! My students LOVE it! As we play through the songs, the kids often say ""Mrs. C this is my jam!."" The songs are new and inventive and the kids enjoy creating music with a background track. It makes them feel like they are making ""real"" music. The Whiteboard tools are great! They are fully prepared for your classroom use- no planning time needed and it includes printables! It doesn't get any better than this!";5;8/22/2011 10:00
845196;Unique and Relevant. Your kids will love it!;I just purchased the Recorder Revolutions book and whiteboard cd combo pack, and after reviewing it,  am very excited to introduce it to our kids next year. The CD rom works great, with or without a whiteboard. The tracks are all modern and relevant, so that our 5th graders will be excited to play them. Mr. Wiegand has a great way of introducing new notes and concepts through catchy songs that the kids play and sing on and will certainly remember.  He has also included singing and Orff arrangements, which is something I was looking for.  I’ve never seen a recorder method book like this one.  It is an integrated and fresh approach that feels like a much more natural progression into the world of recorders for our half hour music classes. Because of this great resource, I’m expecting next year to be a great year for our 5th grade classes!;5;10/31/2011 10:00
845463;Cute book with fun aquatiic creatures;I went to my state music conference, CMEA, and went to a session with Sandy Lantz and Gretchen Wahlberg where they introduced a simple melody that went with the repeating verse from each page.   My grandson loved it and then I used it in classes K-3 and they also loved it.<br /><br />Basically a sweet book with eductional properties!<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Tamela;5;4/25/2013 10:00

846081;Just in time for Spring!;"When you have taught your drumming unit, recorder unit and xylophone unit and you are running out of ideas THEN you are ready for the next step; From Bags to Riches!<br />These arrangements, along with CD and recorder files, are great! I have 4, 5, and 6 grades each <br />working on a different piece and I add the parts as they are able. <br />Thanks Paul!";5;5/12/2013 10:00

846543;This is a great elementary music teaching resource;This is a great elementary music teaching resource, from the authors of Kodaly Today. This includes ENTIRE lesson plans to use in the classroom, as well as assessment rubrics, a song appendix, and book suggestions that connect with the lessons! This is going to save me so much planning time next year- I'll be able to actually focus on the activities and my teaching! Such quality materials AND a huge time saver! This book is great for any Kodaly trained music teacher, but it is clear and thorough enough that it could easily be used by any general music teacher as well. I've been waiting for this book to come out for a couple of years now and I am so excited about using this to plan my lessons for the kindergartners next school year!;5;11/1/2011 10:00
846576;Perfect for students!;I use the teacher edition in class and encourage my students to purchase a student edition to practice at home! They love it! It's all the songs from class time and a cd to practice with! They can play exactly the way we play in class!!;5;11/18/2012 10:00
846611;Great resource!;This is one of the best resources for preschool classes I have found.  It works with 2 year olds but is still fun for kindergarteners.;5;4/4/2012 10:00
846942;Son of Hot Marimba;Walt Hampton, you have brought so much joy to kids, and so much ease and fun to the life of this music teacher. The pieces sell themselves! I have not met a kid who doesn't love them. Bless you!;5;4/15/2020 18:25
846942;Excellent Marimba Music;"I have had the privilege to play these songs at Walt Hampton's ""Hot Marimba"" course for World Music Drumming. It's awesome that these are notated, and I love how Walt introduces his compositions. If your just starting out an Orff ensemble or a marimba ensemble at your school or community it would be best to buy the ""Hot Marimba"" or ""Marimba Mojo"" books first. These books touch more on the rudiments of marimba playing an offer great insights to arranging and playing percussion accompaniments with your group. This book would do well to challenge intermediate -advanced groups in the upper elementary grades, as well as groups in middle school and high school. Great melodies, chords, and song titles; I would highly recommend this being in your library if you teach percussion or Orff at all.";5;9/15/2011 10:00
846978;AWESOME EXPERIENCE;My kids loved this and it was the first boughten musical I have ever done.  VERY easy to direct and the kids really enjoyed the songs.  They are still singing them down the hallways after the concert.  I hope she writes more!;5;12/15/2011 10:00
848368;Excellent Resource;"Another great resource from Artie Almeida!  Of course, as is with most must resources, you will need to adapt her lessons to the students you teach and the resources you have to draw from; and it provides great inspiration for developing your own compositions for your group dynamics.";5;8/9/2012 10:00
848368;Kidstix Resource;I received this publication and was thrilled.  Lessons are sequential in difficulty for learning rhythm.  Additionally, there is a great mix of classical and popular music for students to perform.  I know my students will LOVE  this addition to our curriculum;5;11/5/2011 10:00
848368;GREAT FUN;Love KidStix! This is so easy to use and loads of fun for the kids! I do wish it had included a DVD like Artie's last product, but even so, I give it 5 stars!;5;1/15/2012 10:00
848797;Great Resource;All of Tim’s resources are educationally sound, carefully thought out and fun for both teacher and students. Two thumbs up!;5;3/8/2020 21:32
848798;Love this product!;I love Recorder Revolutions! I started using it this year and I have seen amazing improvement in my student's playing! They are using all of their skills to actually read the music! They love the songs and are motivated to play. I have had so many students ask me for the music so they can practice at home and keep improving. If you are looking to find something new and effective for your students then this is the product for you.;5;12/20/2011 10:00
849095;Great Resource for Boomwhackers;Lessons are very easy to follow and implement.  Mr. Anderson's arrangements provide additional rhythm instruments to join in if you don't have enough Boomwhackers to go around.  Great inspiration for developing your own Boomwhacker arrangements based on his format. Accompaniment tracks are excellent quality.;5;8/11/2012 10:00
849845;Tops on my list of recorder methods;This recorder method in my opinion is one of the best. It allows students to see the note on the staff but the letters name is written in the note. Students are immediately successful and can concentrate on playing the recorder rather than thinking about what note to play and how to play it. It gradually weans the students off the note names after several songs. It has been very successful with my students.;5;2/20/2012 10:00
850221;Music for Creative Dance;This is a great collection of music that my children love to move to!;5;4/21/2012 10:00
850408;You'll Sing a Song;Ella put together such a lovely collection of easy-to-follow and fun to sing along with folk tunes!;5;11/22/2012 10:00
850657;One of the Best Investments for an Orff Teacher;I have studied these CDs deeply, and I believe they helped me really grasp the scope and sequence in the Schulwerk. It is really fun to listen to the pieces and to read the scores and mark them up with teaching ideas and analysis of potential elements to teach that come to mind. You can use the pieces, especially the instrumental ones, for dance creations in the lowest grades, and then revisit the pieces in the higher grades, with the advantage that the students will recognize the piece and be that much closer to improvisational development. Hight recommended for self study and use in the classroom...;5;2/5/2013 10:00

850849;Very Fun;This CD has great songs that my students really enjoy.  I like using it to supplement the curriculum my school district provides.;5;5/16/2012 10:00
850879;Composer's Specials Series, 6 Disc Set;These are great DVD's with wonderful story lines.  They really draw the students into the stories of each of the composers.  They are great for using when teaching about composers, genres or even to leave for a sub!  Would definitely recommend!;5;5/24/2013 10:00
850879;bought them twice;I've had this set for year--in VHS format and couldn't live without the DVD's.  The students and I love the realistic historical pieces in the stories.;5;8/25/2011 10:00
850901;good teacher;It is so much easier for me to teach a dance that I have seen or experienced and this dvd does exactly that.;5;8/24/2011 10:00
851636;Excellent Intro to Instruments Video;The Dallas SO did a phenomenal job with this video.  They had all the families performing different styles and you could actually see the instruments perform.  All the instruments were introduced, but the String family played as a whole instead of each separate of the family.<br />They played a good variety of music, but did used a lot of Tchaikovsky.  <br />My students prefered this over any other instrument video I have;4;12/27/2011 10:00

852339;suitable for younger students;"I had purchased this with the intent of using with my fifth grade classes, but there is no way that my fifth grade boys would do this. Disappointing, because there is a need for interesting, creative movement for ""classical"" music for older students.";3;9/9/2011 10:00
852339;Used it with K-6;I teach in an urban district, and I use both Move It routines with all my classes. The ones with the props are fun for the older kids, and with all of the students. Don't show the DVD to your class, or they may balk. It's the enthusiasm, expression, and fun that you bring to movement that will catch your students' attention.;4;2/1/2012 10:00
852339;Great for Getting them Moving to Great Music;The music selections are varied and wonderful  It is always a good thing to allow students to move<br />and what better than to move to great music!  This DVD is so worthwhile.  ...Highly recommend!;4;5/1/2013 10:00
852410;Good Resource;This is a good resource. I love that the songs are authentic to this time period.;4;3/5/2012 10:00
852472;fun addition;the videos are a fun addition when teaching these songs.  I also like that the words are on the screen to help with reading as the songs are sung;4;8/26/2011 10:00
852514;Great presentation of the instruments;There is an introductory video which shows all of the different instrument families as well as individual videos of each specific instrument family. The character of P.J. is entertaining and keeps the attention of the students.;5;11/30/2012 10:00
852543;Peter and the Wolf;This is too intense for first graders. It would be great for older kids.;3;5/9/2019 16:03
852543;Mesmerizing version;I love this version of Peter and the Wolf.  The animation is extraordinary and captivates the kids.  There is no narration or dialogue - just the music and the visuals, which I LOVE.  Be aware that the duck DOES get eaten in this version.  There is also a scene at the beginning (before the music begins) in which Peter is bullied by the hunters, and they point a gun at him - needless to say, I usually fast-forward through that part.  In the end, Peter decides to forgive and let the wolf go back to the wild.;5;10/14/2011 10:00
852649;Peter and the Wolf is always a winner!;"Our K-5 Students love to watch this 15-minute video of ""Peter and the Wolf""!  They ask for it over and over.  It is a fun introduction to the music instruments as well as a bit of traditional Russian culture.  The 4-minute Benny Goodman quartet immediately following is a fine demonstration of classic jazz style virtuoso playing - just delightful!  This purchase is a good value just for those two segments alone.";4;7/6/2012 10:00
852761;Wonderful tool for substitute lessons!;This dvd is an excellent resource for elementary teachers looking for musically educational substitute plans for non-music teacher subs. Each episode is approximately half an hour long and includes arioso-type warm-ups, easily-learned folk songs in appropriate keys for young voices, creative movement components, and an engaging story. For teachers who use the First Steps in Music program or incorporate Kodaly strategies in their teaching, many of these songs are likely already familiar to your students, allowing instant engagement! These episodes are especially appropriate for kindergarten and 1st grade students, although they may also be well-accepted by some 2nd grade classes.;5;5/2/2013 10:00
852761;Lomax the Hound is awesome;I have heard great things about this video from other teachers and can't wait to use it with my students;5;9/15/2012 10:00
853103;Bass Hall Children's Concert DVD;"This is an outstanding video for students in the primary grades!  Jill Trinka  is a master teacher and has a wonderful rapport with the students in the video - and with students in my music room!  <br />My students are so engaged with the learning in this video that they actually believe Jill can hear them when they respond to her questions.  <br />A definite ""must have"" in my classroom video collection.";5;5/8/2012 10:00
853178;Very Cool Resource;"I really love this resource for my elementary music classroom. I currently do not have a Smart Board, but do have the Smart Notebook Software. I have the kids just manipulate the screen with the mouse.

Each of the activities are fun--and they each have four different levels, so I can use them for every grade I teach.

There are no certain rhythm symbols written in (takadimi, Kodaly, Gordon)--so you are free to use whatever method you use in your classroom.

I love it!";5;7/25/2011 10:00
853179;Drum Fun DVD;I like using games to teach musical concepts and drumming is fun for everyone!;5;9/16/2012 10:00
853246;A great collection!;This is a great collection of pieces that align well with Feierabend's activities for Laban movement.  The pieces are all a good length to use for elementary students and invoke a broad spectrum of feelings.;5;5/7/2013 10:00
853312;Conversational Solfege Explained;Excellent Introduction -;5;11/27/2012 10:00
853315;a great tool;These smart board lesson manipulatives are a great asset to have if you are using the Purposeful Pathways Lessons. Easy to use, colorful and full of great content!;5;3/10/2013 10:00
860396;Great book for beginners;This book has a nice selection of very easy songs for beginners.;5;12/2/2012 10:00
860623;Purposeful Pathways Book 3;I'm looking forward to using the third book in this series By Roger Sams and Beth Ann Hepburn. I've used book 1 & 2 and know that it has the pedagogical lessons I am looking for to include in my teaching with upper elementary students.;5;1/13/2012 10:00
860765;Amazing book! A must have!;I have been lucky enough to attend Tim's workshops a few years ago and have been using some of these regularly. They are amazing! My students look forward to a moving game at the end of class and it is ALWAYS one of Tim's activities! He incorporates books, instruments and just plain gets kids moving and excited about music class! The favorite activity for my students is definitely Spy in the Warehouse! It's so much fun the kids don't even realize they are learning at the same time! A staple of my classroom!;5;2/16/2012 10:00
860765;Excellently Energetic!;"I used several of Tim's ideas recently while being evaluated; the principal stated that it was the best music lesson that he'd ever seen! Tim's songs and ideas are extremely user friendly, and can be used immediately!  Use one or use them all, this book is a MUST HAVE!";5;12/9/2011 10:00
861532;Silly and Serious;I like how even though the songs and chants are mostly familiar to me, the lesson ideas for how to include instruments and movement were things i never thought of before.;5;9/18/2012 10:00
862122;Fun book!;I teach music for grades K-5 and although I've only used this book once for Kindergarten so far, I am excited to use it for K-2 grades throughout the year.  It is very clear with fun ideas that expand on core principles students are already learning. This was a great purchase for me!;5;6/29/2012 10:00
862577;Another gem from Artie!;As always, another gem from Artie Almeida!  Her books and materials never disappoint.  This book has wonderful, engaging lessons to teach and review the instruments of the orchestra: worksheets, listening lessons, flashcards, game pieces and more!  I especially love the connection to the web with WebVisit materials.  Students can extend and enhance their learning at home with these great sites.  Thank you Artie!;5;2/23/2012 10:00
863345;the healing drum;I bought a tank drum and a tongue drum. I was looking for something that would help me learn how to play these drums. I have no musical background but I love the sound the drums make. I actually thought since I am a visual learner that this would help, I was wrong, very disappointed.;1;2/26/2020 10:06
863577;Open book & teach;One of the things I like about this book is that I can open it & immediately use ideas.  I don't have to study the entire book & digest it & think about it for a while before I can use the material in it.;5;11/24/2012 10:00
863577;Great book with tons of lessons!;I work at 2 different schools plus direct a children’s choir at church and my students love it when I teach them a new rhyme from this book. They are fun and engaging - and yes, those are 2 different things. You will not go wrong buying this great resource to teach rhythms, ensemble work, form, body percussion, and instrument playing.;5;4/28/2013 10:00
863577;New and Original;This resource is fantastic.  The lessons and activities are new and original designed to engage the students developing many skill sets that fit all core standards.  This resource is one of my “Go To” books for quick and exciting lessons that my students love and further deepen their appreciation for music.;5;8/22/2018 16:26
863577;Great Resource!!!;I teach at two schools with very different populations and this book works great at both. I used a lesson during an observation and received positive comments regarding the level of engagement and rigor. Many lessons also provide suggested H.O.T. topics and ideas for adding classroom instruments!;5;1/4/2013 10:00
863930;Expanding First Steps for the Orff Specialist!!!;As a veteran teacher, I am using First Steps with my pre-k classes for the first time.  I enjoy having the FS w/OS book to help me present the concepts using my Orff background.  The book is extremely user friendly and gives the FS curriculum a little spice.  The book is consise and to the point.  I am enjoying having some new ideas to my old favorites!!!;5;9/27/2012 10:00
863930;Outstanding classroom resource!;This book is a must for all elementary music teachers! The practical lesson ideas, tips, methodology information and carefully researched resource materials are presented in a clear and easy to use format. Check this out!;5;12/27/2012 10:00
864665;Excellent!;This is such a creative way to teach recorder.  My students are excited, engaged and loving it!;5;2/9/2013 10:00
866411;GREAT baby gift.;I use this set in my Infant Music Classes, as it's great for tracking, visual focus etc. etc.  It's also a SUPER 'new baby' gift.;5;11/21/2018 9:23
866819;Another great resource from Artie!;Very teacher/student friendly!  Can't wait to use these lessons with my students!  Anything from Artie is going to be excellent!  Engaging, Educational and Energetic!;5;5/27/2013 10:00
867089;BEST SPED RESOURCE;This is the BEST resource on teaching students with special needs from Adhd, dyslexia, autism, visual and physical impairments, etc. Alice Hammel and Ryan Hourigan are master teachers and have put this teacher resource guide to help us all be better teachers with the most difficult learners. The guide is simple and gives real life student examples from around the country. EVERY MUSIC TEACHER should have this book!!! However, if you're not a music teacher, you can still get tips from them, too!! :) Plus, if you email them they will even get back to you :);5;8/17/2021 12:07
867265;Excellent Song Resource;This book is beautifully illustrated and the downloadable song makes it perfect for the end of any elementary music class.  The kids have loved all of the books in the series.;5;6/2/2013 10:00
867871;GREAT RESOURCE;"Tim has done it again!  This was a perfect resource for my 3rd graders especially!  Comic books are making a come back and this fits wonderfully into their scope of interest. They kept asking for more.  ""When will we hear more about Johnny Jazz?"".  We had a lot of fun learning simple recorder songs with great back tracks and beating the Coda Bots by playing our songs correctly!";5;6/4/2021 8:59

867880;Johnny Jazz;"Tim Wiegand knocks it out of the park with this interactive play along music adventure. My 4th and 5th grade students were engaged and captivated with the story of Johnny Jazz. This is a fun way to reinforce the recorder notes: B, A, G, E & D. This is a ""rockin'"" must have for your recorder curriculum. My students can't wait to see what happens next!";5;6/2/2021 16:48
867978;Music teacher approved;I have been an elementary music teacher for just over 20 years. I have always wanted my students to use instruments in my classroom on a mostly daily basis, but always fell short of that goal. This book gave me the resources to use instruments with most of my classes on an almost daily basis! If you are a music teacher and enjoy having your students play instruments in class, this will not disappoint!;5;7/27/2020 14:50
870120;Great use of common objects;At least half of the ideas in the book can be used or adapted for distance learning.  The rest will be great when we get back to traditional school.;5;4/12/2020 15:08
871492;Invaluable;Writing a grant always seemed like a huge undertaking. This book is so well-organized and it feels like the author is holding your hand through every step of the process. I'm excited to say that I am submitting a grant and it's all because of this resource! EVERY MUSIC TEACHER NEEDS THIS BOOK!;5;2/28/2020 16:51
871492;Outstanding;I picked up this little gem at the AOSA conference this year.  Let me tell you, it's a fantastic resource.  I have always thought about writing a grant to increase the number of Orff instruments in my room.  There are so many excellent practical ideas, and they are so well organized!  I have just sent in my first ever grant proposal this year, and I'm very grateful for all the wonderful tips in this book!;5;2/12/2020 12:22
874617;Great for animal lovers;From owls in trees to sneaky foxes, cool coyotes and perplexing porcupines, this is a playful piano collection! Some songs are slow and others fast. In conclusion, I believe you'll have fun with this!!;5;8/23/2021 11:18
